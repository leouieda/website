## Abstract

In this tutorial we'll talk about a widely used method of interpretation for
potential-field data called Euler deconvolution. Our goal is to demonstrate its
usefulness and, most importantly, call attention to some pitfalls encountered
in the interpretation of the results. The code and synthetic data required to
reproduce our results and figures can be found in the accompanying IPython
notebooks ([ipython.org/notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook))
at [dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.923450](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.923450)
or [github.com/pinga-lab/paper-tle-euler-tutorial](https://github.com/pinga-lab/paper-tle-euler-tutorial).
The notebooks also expand the
analysis presented here. We encourage you to download the data and try it on
your software of choice. For this tutorial we'll use the implementation in the
open-source Python package Fatiando a Terra
([fatiando.org](http://fatiando.org)).
