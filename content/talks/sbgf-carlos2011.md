## Abstract

We have interpreted the airborne gravity gradiometry data from Quadrilátero
Ferrífero, an iron ore province in southeastern Brazil. Aiming at retrieving
the geometry of the iron body, we have used a fast and novel gravity inversion
method for estimating a 3D density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of
prisms. This inversion approach combines robust data-fitting with an iterative
procedure that does not require the solution of a large equation system. By
using a systematic search algorithm, the estimated mass grows around prismatic
elements called “seeds”. The interpreter specifies the locations and the
associated density contrasts of the seeds. Automatically, the inversion method
fits the observations and favors compact gravity sources closest to the seeds.
To produce a more robust data fitting than least-squares fit, the inversion
method minimizes the L1–norm of the residuals. Hence, it allows the presence of
large residuals, so that outliers produced by non-targeted bodies can be
handled. By using 126 seeds which were assigned density contrasts of 0.5 g.cm-3
and whose locations were based on our knowledge about the QF area, we have
retrieved a continuous elongated iron body that fits the observed components of
the gravity gradient. Our inversion result agrees reasonably with previous
geophysical interpretations. In addition, our result honors the borehole
information about the iron body depth.
