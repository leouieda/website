I'm not a programmer by trait,
but during my bachelor's
I learned to love computers and
making them work for me.
I am the main developer of the open-source packages:

* [Fatiando a Terra](http://www.fatiando.org): a
  [Python](http://www.python.org) package for geophysical modeling and
  inversion
* [Tesseroids](http://leouieda.github.io/tesseroids/): a command-line toolkit
  for the forward modeling of gravity fields in spherical coordinates

You'll find other open-source code by me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/leouieda).
