I'm not a programmer by trait or training.
I learned most of the computing skills
that make my life much easier
from the excellent [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/).
If you haven't yet, I highly recommend that you go study their lessons or
sign-up for a bootcamp.

I develop a few open-source packages. I'm the main (or sole) developer for some
of them.

## Fatiando a Terra

A [Python](http://www.python.org) package for geophysical modeling and
  inversion


[Fatiando a Terra](http://www.fatiando.org): * [Tesseroids](http://leouieda.github.io/tesseroids/): a command-line toolkit
  for the forward modeling of gravity fields in spherical coordinates

You'll find other open-source code by me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/leouieda).
