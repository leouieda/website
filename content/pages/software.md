I'm not a programmer by trait or training.
I learned most of the computing skills
that make my life much easier
from the excellent [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/).
If you haven't yet, I highly recommend that you go study their lessons or
sign-up for a bootcamp.

You'll find open-source code, conference material, code for articles,
and other things by me on [GitHub](https://github.com/leouieda).

This website is generated using the static-site generator
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/).
If you're interested,
here is [source code for generating this site](https://github.com/leouieda/website).

The main projects I develop are:

* [Fatiando a Terra](http://www.fatiando.org): A Python package for geophysical
  modeling and inversion.
* [Tesseroids](http://www.leouieda.com/tesseroids/): Command-line tools for the
  forward modeling of gravity fields in spherical coordinates.
