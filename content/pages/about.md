Hello, my name is **Leonardo Uieda** and
I'm a geophysicist  working mainly on potential field inverse problems.
At the moment I'm a PhD student
at the [Observat√≥rio Nacional](http://www.on.br), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
My main interests include, but are not limited to:
[inverse problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem),
[open-source software](https://github.com/leouieda),
and
[Northern Shaolin Kung Fu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Kowk_Wai).

You'll find me around the internet as

and
[+Leonardo Uieda](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LeonardoUieda) on Google+.
