Hello, my name is **Leonardo Uieda** and
I'm a geophysicist  working mainly on potential field inverse problems.
At the moment I'm a PhD student
at the [Observatório Nacional](http://www.on.br), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
My main interests include, but are not limited to:
[inverse problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem),
[open-source software](https://github.com/leouieda),
and
[Northern Shaolin Kung Fu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Kowk_Wai).

You'll find me around the internet as
[@leouieda](https://twitter.com/leouieda) on Twitter
and
[+Leonardo Uieda](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LeonardoUieda) on Google+.

I am a member of the [PINGA](https://github.com/pinga-lab) lab,
a research group for inverse problems in geophysics.
In the group page,
we provide repositories
with the source code for the papers we publish
and other things we are working on.
