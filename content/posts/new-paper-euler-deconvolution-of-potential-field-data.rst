*This post is a bit late (almost a month actually) but here it goes.*

We have new publication in
the `April issue`_
of `The Leading Edge`_!
You can grad a copy
from the `journal website`_ (it's open-access!)
or read it on the `SEG Wiki`_,
where any SEG member can edit.
The code to run everything
as well as extra text and explanations
are available in a `PINGA lab repository`_
or on `figshare`_ at
`dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.923450`_.

The tutorial is about
the uses of Euler deconvolution
to interpret potential field data,
particularly magnetic data.
This is a very common technique
that is relatively simple
to use and to implement.
It is present in most (if not all)
major commercial geophysical software for potential fields.
However, this simplicity can be misleading.
Confidence in the results is often overestimated
and can lead to (very) wrong conclusions.
So much so,
that Alan Reid,
one of the pioneers in Euler deconvolution
(and the one that gave it its name),
and collaborators wrote an article about it
(Reid et al., 2014).

This tutorial is the second
in the new Geophysical Tutorials section
started by Matt Hall (`@kwinkunks`_)
of `Agile Geoscience`_.
If you haven't already,
go read `his tutorial about smoothing`_.
The tutorials section
is a radical experiment in openness
by part of the SEG
and I congratulate everyone involved
(especially Matt for the initiative).
I hope to see more of this from the SEG.

If you have any feedback
(additions to the tutorial, corrections, ideas, anything at all)
leave a comment bellow,
edit the wiki,
or send us a pull request on Github!

*Have an idea for your own tutorial?
Contact Matt and make it happen!*
