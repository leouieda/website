I have been `taking part in the #sciwrite challenge`_
and the second week has come and gone.
So how am I doing so far?
Not very well.
From `my list of 3 goals`_,
so far I've only completed the first:
*finish and submit the review of a paper*.
That ended up being
**a lot** more work
than I expected.
But thankfully that is done
and was submitted last week!

Today, I started tackling the second goal:

* Finish the article about my software package
  Tesseroids_ for the
  `Journal of Open Research Software`_ (JORS).

In the spirit of `open-science`_,
the manuscript in preparation is
in `a repository online on GitHub`_.
I'll push changes there
as I fill in the manuscript text.

Chris (`@Allochthonous`_)
and
Anne (`@highlyanne`_)
have `checked-in on their process`_
and, sadly, nobody seems to be doing too well.
But that is what `the rest of us`_
are here for!
To give context and support
and show that **you are not alone**
in the struggle with
the `never ending deadlines and TODOs`_.

One problem that I continuously have
is starting.
Getting those first sentences written down
is always a struggle for inspiration.
After this initial hurdle
the writing flows pretty well.
But that initial barrier
is my main motivation-killer,
and the reason why
so many writing projects
sit on my shelf for so long.
Starting this blog
is helping me a little with this
and the #sciwrite challenge
has been motivating!
I definitely plan on
using something like this
with my future students.

So how about **you**?
Do you have any of these problems (or others)?
Or, even better, tips for overcoming them?
Let me know in the comments!
