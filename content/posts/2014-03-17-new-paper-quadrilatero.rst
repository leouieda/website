We have a new publication in
*Ore Geology Reviews*!
You can get it from the `journal website`_
(`here is a PDF`_ if you don't have access).

This is part of the PhD thesis of `Dionisio Uendro Carlos`_
and I was really glad to be a part of it.
He used my `3D inversion algorithm`_
(`PDF </pdf/paper-planting-anomalous-densities-2012.pdf>`__)
to model airborne gravity-gradient data
collected over an important iron ore deposit
in Brazil.
The 3D renderings of the model are particularly nice!

He used the implementation in `Fatiando a Terra`_
to run the inversion
but made the plots using other software.

If you have any comments/suggestions/complaints
or if you'd like to use this inversion method on your data,
leave a comment bellow
or tweet me `@leouieda`_.
