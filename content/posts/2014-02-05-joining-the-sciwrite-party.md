A few days ago,
Chris Rowan ([@Allochthonous](https://twitter.com/allochthonous))
and
Anne Jefferson ([@highlyanne](https://twitter.com/highlyanne))
from [Highly Allochthonous](http://all-geo.org/highlyallochthonous/)
called people to band together (digitally)
for a month of science writing:
[#sciwrite v2.0](
http://all-geo.org/highlyallochthonous/2014/02/28-days-of-sciwrite/)!
The point is to publicly set writing goals for yourself
and post updates on the progress
using the hashtag
[#sciwrite](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sciwrite&src=hash&f=realtime)
on Twitter.
Quoting from [their post](
http://all-geo.org/highlyallochthonous/2014/02/28-days-of-sciwrite/):

> With the idea that a little public accountability never hurt anyone, and that
> maybe **having a community of people all going through the same writing process**
> **at the same time could actually help make life better**, we'd like to introduce
> February 2014 as #sciwrite v 2.0. For the next four weeks, weâ€™ll be
> committing to writing every day and sharing our goals and progress here on
> the blog on a weekly basis. We'd love it if other people joined us.

This is a fantastic idea!

I'm a little late to the party but here are my personal goals:

* Finish writing the corrections for the review I just got back.
* Finish the article about my software
  [Tesseroids](http://www.leouieda.com/tesseroids/) for the
  [Journal of Open Research Software](http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/)
  (JORS).
  This will be written in the open on the [paper-software-tesseroids](
  https://github.com/pinga-lab/paper-software-tesseroids) repository on the
  [PINGA-LAB](https://github.com/pinga-lab) GitHub page.
  Feel free to make any suggestions/corrections/questions.
* Write another article for JORS
  about my Python library for geophysical modeling and inversion
  [Fatiando a Terra](http://fatiando.org/).

The last goal is a bit ambitious
and I'm not sure I'll make it.
But at least this will
force me to get started.
So keep an eye out for
[#sciwrite](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sciwrite&src=hash&f=realtime)
on Twitter
and follow me
([@leouieda](https://twitter.com/leouieda))
for updates.

Come join the party!
