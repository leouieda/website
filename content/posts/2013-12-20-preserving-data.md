Today, I read
[this article](
http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-losing-data-at-a-rapid-rate-1.14416)
on Nature News
about a study
on the availability of scientific data.
The thing that alarmed me the most
was that
the study found that
only 20% of data
from published articles in 1990s
could be found
**by their own authors**!
And from my experience,
this is not an exaggeration.

Organizing and preserving data
is not an easy task.
There are even people who
[study and specialize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science)
in this.
If you need a Bachelor's degree
to do something properly,
then it is probably far from trivial.
Keeping the data on a hard-drive organized
is already difficult,
so imagine the trouble of doing that
for data on paper!
Madness!
But don't despair!
There are people working on
making things tractable for us mere mortals.

The team at
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
teaches basic computer literacy.
Little things that
are not covered in introductory (or advanced) classes
but make all the difference.
I recommend the lectures on
[data management](http://software-carpentry.org/v4/data/index.html)
and
[version control](http://software-carpentry.org/v4/vc/index.html)
(probably the most important of all).
There are also great essays on
[saving and loading data](http://software-carpentry.org/v4/essays/persist.html)
and the importance of recording the
[provenance of the data](
http://software-carpentry.org/v4/essays/provenance.html).

Once you have your data tidy on your hard-drive,
services like [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/)
and [figshare](http://figshare.com/)
provide online archiving, sharing, and citing.
Each publication on figshare gets a
[DOI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier),
like [10.6084/m9.figshare.91469](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.91469).
Views and shares are tracked,
so you get immediate feedback.
You can even embed the publications on websites:

<iframe src="http://wl.figshare.com/articles/91469/embed?show_title=0"
width="375" height="300" frameborder="0" style="padding-bottom:10px"></iframe>

To me, the challenge of
preserving, archiving, sharing, and making data discoverable
online is pretty much solved.
The main obstacle now is not technology, it's people.
**So help make people aware such tools and services exist.**
Talk to your friends, colleagues, co-workers, advisors, parents,
random people at conferences.
Demand that policy makers
enforce openness and sharing.
Advisors,
demand publication of your students data.
Students,
get informed and help shape the future of science!

The move toward openness is inevitable.
Scientists,
specially PhD students and post-docs,
must be at the front-line of change
or risk getting left behind.
