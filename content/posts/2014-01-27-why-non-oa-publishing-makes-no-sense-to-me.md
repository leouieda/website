I first encountered the reality of scientific publishing back in 2011.
At the time,
I was finishing my Masters degree
at the [Observat√≥rio Nacional](http://www.on.br)
and was writing [the paper that would be my
dissertation](http://fatiando.org/blog/first-publication/index.html).
That was the first time I realised
that authors actually pay to publish.
Never mind that reviewers are practically slave labor
(and are expected to be happy about it)
and publishers charge money for access to articles.
What shocked me the most is that
the journal not only didn't even bother
to send me an e-mail saying that my paper was published,
but I (the author!) wouldn't even have a copy
if my institution didn't have access.
That is completely insane!

Lets imagine the following scenario:
I am a musician.
I write songs for a living.
They are the product of my inspiration,
creativity, and
hours upon hours of hard work.
When I finish a new song,
and want to release it to the world,
I go looking for a record company.
I look hard and try to find the one
that I think would better represent and expose my song.
After I've found one (and they accept my song),
I go into recording and
have a bunch of talented people (technicians, musicians, etc)
critique and tweak my song to make it the best it can be.
The end product is a recorded single,
with a nice cover and mixing.
(OK, I probably got a lot of that process wrong, but bear with me.)

Now imagine that the technicians, musicians, etc that review my song
all work for the pure joy of it.
They are completely voluntary.
And instead of getting a nice pay check
from my record sales,
I have to pay the company
for the privilege of having their name and prestige on my record.
As a bonus,
if I want to hear the finished product
I have to go out and buy the CD.

That doesn't seem like
a very smart thing for musicians to do,
does it?
And I doubt that record companies would still exist
if they adopted this kind of business model.

So why do scientists,
the creators of the things that publishers sell,
give their articles for free
or even pay to publish?
That only makes sense to me
if the publisher makes money
from the authors exclusively
and provides the articles for free
(i.e., [open access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access)).
In that case,
scientists are paying
for the dissemination, archival, and tracking of
the knowledge they generated.
In turn, they get access to
the knowledge generated by others
and are able to build upon it,
completing the cycle.
That is the service
that the publishers provide.
And I would pay for that.

However, if they intend to sell my article
for a profit
then I sure as hell don't want to
give it to them for free,
let alone pay for it.
What is the service they provide
that makes it worth it for me
to give them my article,
my baby,
the fruit of my creativity,
inspiration, and
years of hard work?
Copy editing and putting it on the internet?
No thanks, I have
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/),
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/), and
[figshare](http://figshare.com/) for that.
Peer review?
Besides the whole discussion
on [whether or not peer-review is actually effective](
http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2013/10/04/open-access-is-not-the-problem/),
there are new services that
could take peer-review out of publishers hands,
like [Peerage of Science](http://www.peerageofscience.org/).
Sure, prestigious journals provide
a ([questionably](
https://chroniclevitae.com/news/291-what-s-the-point-of-academic-publishing))
larger visibility,
but is that really worth
all the money that we,
the tax payers,
pay them for subscriptions?

Just to be clear,
I'm not advocating
that authors and reviewers
should be paid by journals.
The thing that bothers me is that
the articles that we provide them for free
are then sold back to us.
So, to me, the move to open-access publishing
is the only way forward.
I just wonder why it took so long in the first place.
