Today I'm announcing a new release (v1.1.1) of
my open-source software project
Tesseroids_.
This is a minor bug fix release, so nothing has changed much since v1.1.
See the changelog_ for details.

*Tesseroids* is a suite of command-line programs
that do `forward modeling`_ of the `gravity field`_
in spherical coordinates.
In other words,
it computes the gravity field
caused by a mass model
defined in spherical coordinates (longitude, latitude, and height).
The mass model
can be made up of
`right rectangular prisms`_
or of `tesseroids (or spherical prisms)`_.

    :alt: A right rectangular prism defined in a geocentric coordinate system

    A **right rectangular prism** (left) and a **tesseroid** (right)
    in a geocentric coordinate system (X, Y, Z).
    The prism is located in spherical coordinates by point Q
    and is aligned with the center of the Earth.
    The tesseroid has curved edges
    and fits perfectly on a section of a sphere.

But why would want to do this?
Well, this allows us to calculate
`the anomaly in the gravity field`_
caused the varying density of Earth.
If we have measured the gravity anomaly,
we can make different hypothesis
about the density variations
that caused the anomaly
and then test them
by comparing calculated data
to the observed data.
So gravity anomalies allow us to
"peek" into the inner structure of the Earth,
since different rocks often have different densities.

Gravity can `be measured`_
on land,
airplanes,
ships,
and even satellites!
The latest of these satellite missions is GOCE_
by the European Space Agency.
Recently, Panet et al. (2014) have
`used the gravity gradient data from GOCE
to investigate density changes in the Earth's mantle`_.
Here is the full reference to their article:

    Panet, I., G. Pajot-Métivier, M. Greff-Lefftz, L. Métivier, M. Diament,
    and M. Mandea (2014), Mapping the mass distribution of Earth's mantle using
    satellite-derived gravity gradients, Nature Geoscience,
    doi:10.1038/ngeo2063.

Have a look at
the documentation_ and `official site`_
for more details about the software and methods.

As always,
let me know if
you come across any bugs,
have any feature requests,
or complaints.
