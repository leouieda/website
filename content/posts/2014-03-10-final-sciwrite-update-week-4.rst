February is gone,
the `#sciwrite challenge`_ has passed,
and `the final checkin was made over at Highly Allochthonous`_.
I have to admit,
`my initial goals`_
were way too bold:
1 reply to reviewers of an article and
write (or at least start) 2 manuscripts.
I wasn't nearly as productive
as I would have liked,
though that was to be expected
since I just started a new job
as an Assistant Professor
at UERJ_.
I had to get adjusted to the new workplace
and sort out all the paper work
involved in state employment in Brasil
(bureaucracy capital of the world).
But besides all that,
I managed to get some things done.

My `first 2 weeks`_ were spent on goal #1.
Not optimal but it was time well spent.
That article has now
been accepted for publication
in Ore Geology Reviews
(an early release is
`already available on their website`_).
I'll put the pdf up for download
on `my publications page`_
once it's officially out.

Regarding the 2 manuscripts,
I started drafting the first
(about my software Tesseroids_)
in `a public GitHub repository`_
over at the `PINGA Lab page`_.
There is still nothing
substantial over there
besides the basic template of the journal
and an initial outline.
The second manuscript hasn't even crossed my mind.

Even though I didn't
even come close to achieving my goals,
I still found the whole experience quite rewarding.
And working with
well established goals in mind
keeps me focused on the important things
(most of the time).
So, as an experiment,
I intend to keep making
monthly goals for myself
and posting them to the blog.

For this month
(March 2014),
my goals will be:

* Submit an abstract to the `2014 Scipy Conference`_. If you use Python for
  Science, you should be there! (Deadline March 14th, this Friday)
* Write an expanded abstract for the SEG Annual Meeting. (Deadline April 2nd)
* Finish the Tesseroids paper. This has no deadline so it will probably not be
  a priority.

That is a lot of work for one month
especially since I might have to
teach an undergraduate course
starting next week.
But I'm optimistic
and will try my best.
Next week I'll check-in
and let you know how
things worked out.
