This presentation is about the work Dionisio did for his PhD.
He used my [planting inversion method][/papers/paper-planting-anomalous-densities-2012]
on data from his research area in central Brazil.
He couldn't make it to the meeting so I ended up giving the talk on his behalf.

# Abstract

We have interpreted the airborne gravity gradiometry data from Carajás Mineral
Province (CMP), Brazil, by using two different 3D inversion methods. Both
inversion methods parameterized the Earth's subsurface into prismatic cells and
estimate the 3D density-contrast distribution that retrieves an image of
geologic sources subject to an acceptable data misfit. The first inversion
method imposes smoothness on the solution by solving a linear system that
minimizes an depth weighted L2 model objective function of density-contrast
distribution. The second imposes compactness on the solution by using an
iterative growth algorithm solved by a systematic search algorithm that
accretes mass around user-specified prisms called “seeds”. Using these two
inversion methods, the interpretation of full tensor gravity gradiometry data
from an iron ore deposit in the area named N1 at CMP shows the consistent
geometry and the depth of iron orebody. To date, the maximum depth of the iron
orebody is assumed to be 200 m based on the maximum depth attained by the
deepest well drilled in this study area. However, both inversion results
exhibit a source whose maximum bottom depth is greater than 200 m. These
results give rise two interpretations: i) the iron orebody may present its
depth to the bottom greater than the maximum depth of 200 m attained by the
deepest borehole; or ii) the iron orebody may be 200 m deep and the rocks below
may be jaspilite whose density is close to that of soft hematite.
