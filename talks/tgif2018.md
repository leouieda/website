# About

I gave this presentation at the TGIF Seminar series of the
[Department of Earth Sciences](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/index.html), University of
Hawaii at Manoa.

The topic merges my interest in machine learning, how we can
[borrow some techniques for geophysical inversion][/papers/paper-moho-inversion-tesseroids-2016],
and the [similarities with gridding problems][/papers/verde], like my work on
[GPS gridding][/talks/aogs2018].

# Abstract

Machine learning is the new trend sweeping across the Earth Sciences. From the oil and
gas industry to oceanography, these algorithms are being trained to solve previously
unsolvable (or extremely tedious) problems. But what exactly is "machine learning" and
what can be done with it? In this talk, I will present a brief high-level overview of
some of the core concepts and interesting applications of machine learning methods to
geoscience data. I will also explore some of the best practices and techniques that can
be applied to geophysical inversion and interpolation methods, including a new method
for gridding 3-component GPS data.
