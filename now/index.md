## Research

Last year, I decided that this would be the main focus when I got back to
Brazil.
FAPESP has a Young Investigator grant that I can apply to and it would offer a
great way to bootstrap a research group.
Plus, there are enough funds to make it easy to bring my PhD student at
Liverpool to São Paulo a couple of times.
This is taking up a large amount of time because I'm having to figure out how
everything works at FAPESP and come up with activities and things to fund with
the project.
I'm also just now adjusting to life back in Brazil and getting settled in my
role.

My research productivity hit a slump during the pandemic and the worse of times
in Liverpool and is only now picking back up. This means that I have a gap in
my publication for 2022 and 2023, which grant reviewers have picked up on
(and ignored the extenuating circumstances that I stated...). So I decided to
focus on wrapping up some old and current ongoing papers and get them submitted
as soon as I can before I try to submit anything big to FAPESP. This will
increase my chances of getting the grant. I'm also hoping to get more motivated
by science, focusing on the interesting bits and leaving the pointless search
for money and numbers aside for a bit.

## Getting back into Fatiando

For the last 2 years, I barely found the time to work on [Fatiando a Terra]({{
config.links.fatiando }}), which is my passion project and probably one of my
greatest contributions to geophysics.
This year, I decided to dedicate more time to the project and allow myself at
least 1 day per week to work on the project.
If this move to Brazil was about finding a better work-life balance, having
time to do the work I enjoy the most must be a part of it.

## Software Underground

I have been in the [Software Underground]({{ config.links.swung }}) for a while
now but only recently have I started taking a more active approach. I really
think the SwUng can be the best professional society out there in my field and
I want to put in the work to make this happen. This means organizing the
society so it can handle transitions of the board and figuring out what our
long-term goals are as a society.

## Music

I spent the last 4 years without any social activities outside of work and
family. This year, I returned to the choir I used to sing in back during my
days as an undergrad at USP over 15 years ago. This one is particularly fun
because the barriers to entry are small (or I wouldn't be in it) and they take
songs from many different cultures from around the world. I want to reconnect
with music and people who aren't work colleagues and this has been a wonderful
way to do it. It means time away from home but we're managing.

I'm also hoping to pick up my guitar and ukulele more often. It's not always
easy when I want to be in bed by 21:00 but I think it's worth it. Part of this
also needs me listening to more music so I don't get bore of playing the same
tunes for the past 20 years. I'm even considering signing up for some music
lessons if I can find the time.
