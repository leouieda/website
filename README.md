This is the source code for my personal site
[leouieda.com](http://www.leouieda.com).

It's built using [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) and hosted on
[Github pages](https://github.com/leouieda/leouieda.github.com).

## Dependencies

You'll need the following to build the website:

* Pelican (3.5.0)
* markdown (2.4)
* beautifulsoup4 (4.3.2)

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

    pip install pelican==3.5.0 markdown==2.4 beautifulsoup4==4.3.2

After cloning this repository, you'll need to initialized the git submodules
for the `pelican-plugins`:

    cd pelican-plugins
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

This only needs to be done once.

## Compiling the site

Use the `Makefile`:

    make
    make serve

The command `make serve` will start a simple server at the `output` dir
where the built HTML files are.
Point your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8001](http://127.0.0.1:8001)
to view the site.
Use `Ctrl+C` to kill the server.

## The theme

The website theme is made using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
and tweaked from the Cosmo [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) theme.
Icons are provided by [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and
[Academicons](http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/).

The Jinja2 templates and CSS are located in the `theme` folder.
I really should make this theme more generic and provide it to the world.
But, you know, time and things.
You can still use it by copying the `theme` folder to your own project.
I can't guarantee that things will work without my specific folder struture in
`content`.

## Adding an article/talk/course/software

The papers, talks, courses and software entries are basically blog posts, each
in a different category.
Categories are defined as folders in `content`.
Each entry gets it's own `.md` file.
The site theme takes a lot of extra metadata in the post to make the "Info"
section of each entry.

To add a new entry, create the `.md` file in the corresponding category.

## Metadata for entries

### Papers

## Automatic deploy with TravisCI

The site is automatically built and deployed to
[leouieda/leouieda.github.com](https://github.com/leouieda/leouieda.github.com)
every time a commit is pushed to the *master* branch.
See files `.travis.yml` and `.update-website.sh`.
