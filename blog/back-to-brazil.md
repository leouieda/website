I've been in the UK for just under 4 years, during which we survived the
craziness of lockdown and online teaching, had a kid, traveled, made friends,
and got experience life as first-time parents away from close family.
It was an incredible experience and I learned so much about myself, the UK
academic system, and many different parts of the geosciences that I hadn't had
contact with until now.

Just when I had finished buying new furniture, nice 4k monitors, and a load of
plants to make it look nice...
