[a list of podcasts recommendations](http://www.johnrleeman.com/2017/01/03/podcasts-im-listening-to/)
and I thought I'd share mine here as well.
I have been listening to podcasts since around 2014 and I've experimented with
a few before finding some that I really enjoy.
I still subscribe to some new podcasts when I find them.
I'll listen to a couple of episodes but lately none have stuck with me¹.

Here are the ones that stayed with me throughout 2016:

* [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/): The one that got me started
  with podcasts. A light conversation between two friends who make science
  videos on YouTube.
* [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex): [CGP Grey](http://www.cgpgrey.com/)
  and [Myke Hurley](http://www.mykehurley.net/) talk about productivity and
  running small businesses.
* [Imaginary Worlds](http://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.org/): "A show about how
  we create them and why we suspend our disbelief". One of my favorites. If
  you're looking for a place to start, try episode
  [Dumbledore's Army](http://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.org/dumbledore-s-army.html)
  (even if you don't like Harry Potter).
* [Invisibilia](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia): A series about
  the forces that shape our lives. Also one of my favorites.
* [Talk Python To Me](https://talkpython.fm/): The title pretty much says it
  all.
* [Undersampled Radio](https://undersampledrad.io/): Geeky and fun interviews,
  mostly about geo/science/technology.
* [Don't Panic Geocast](http://www.dontpanicgeocast.com/):
  [John Leeman](http://www.johnrleeman.com) and
  [Shannon Dulin](https://twitter.com/shannondulin) talk about all things
  geoscience (sometimes with very interesting guests).
* [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/): Interesting stories about all sorts of
  topics. Very high quality production.

And here are the ones that I tried but ended up dropping for some reason:

* [Note to Self](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/notetoself)
* [Science Friday](http://www.sciencefriday.com/)
* [Podcast.\_\_init\_\_](https://www.podcastinit.com/)
* [Star Talk](https://www.startalkradio.net/)
* [Changelog](https://changelog.com/)

I subscribe and listen to all of them using the
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en)
app on my Android phone.
You can also get most of them through Google Play Music or iTunes.

*What are your recommendations?*
