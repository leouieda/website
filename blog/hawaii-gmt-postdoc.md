Back in July of 2016, I applied for a postdoc position to work on the
[Generic Mapping Tools](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/) with
Professor [Paul Wessel](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/)
at the University of Hawaii.
After two and half years as a [Professor at UERJ](/about),
struggling to teach classes without any experience or time to prepare,
all while finishing [my PhD][/about/phd],
I was eager to do something different.
Meanwhile, Brazil was (and still is) in a huge economic and political crisis
and Rio was hit pretty bad.
The University, which is State owned, was on strike from March 2016 until after
the Olympic games in August.
The time was ripe to apply for something different abroad.
