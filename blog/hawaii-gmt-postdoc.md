Back in July 2016, I applied for a postdoc position to work on the
[Generic Mapping Tools](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/) with
Professor [Paul Wessel](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/).

I had just finished [my PhD][/about/phd] and was eager to do something
different.

Brazil was in crisis and Rio was bad.

Since March the university (UERJ) was on a strike that ultimately lasted 6
months.

Classes started only after the Olympic Games.

The time was ripe to apply for something different abroad.
