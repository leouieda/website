## TL;DR

Install Termux from Google Play, open it and run:

```bash
$ apt install clang python python-dev fftw libzmq libzmq-dev freetype freetype-dev libpng libpng-dev pkg-config
$ LDFLAGS=" -lm -lcompiler_rt" pip install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter
$ jupyter notebook
```

Copy the URL printed to the screen (it will look something like
`http://localhost:8888/?token=longstringofcharacters`)
and paste it into Chrome/Firefox. Enjoy!

Read on for more tips and a few tweaks.

**Update (25-01-2017):**
There were a few dependencies that I had left out of the instructions for
installing numpy et al. I edited the post to make things more complete and
clear.

## Some background

I bought my first tablet last October, an
[NVIDIA Shield K1](https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-SHIELD-K1-Tablet-Black/dp/B0171BS9CG/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1484937529&sr=1-2&keywords=nvidia+shield+k1).
I had been putting off getting one because I never could think of a good use
for them.
I have my phone for messaging and Internet, my kindle for reading, and my
Linux laptop for working.
It seemed to me that the tablet would be a nice toy but not something I could
use and justify the purchase.

The dream would be to be able to ditch my laptop and do actual work on the
tablet.
Mark O'Connor wrote about doing just that on
[Yield Thought](http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad)
but he cheats a bit by running everything on a Linode server.
And how does anyone do scientific programming these days without a Jupyter
notebook?

I finally gave in, thinking that I would use the tablet mainly for reading
papers and taking notes.
Maybe even play a few games.
Then I discovered [Termux](https://termux.com/).


## Show, don't tell

Here is a screencast of me running a Jupyter notebook
server on my tablet.
Notice that the URL is `localhost:8888/` so this is not a remote server.

## Setting up your terminal

Install Termux from Google Play and open it.
You'll be dropped into a bash terminal, like the one below.

![Blank Termux startup screen](/images/termux-blank.png)

Termux uses the `apt` package manager so you can install packages pretty much
like you would on Debian/Ubuntu.

The first thing I do on any new computer is install git so that I can fetch my
[configuration files from GitHub](https://github.com/leouieda/dotfiles):

```bash
$ apt install git
```

Before cloning the repository, I need to generate a new SSH key (only required
if you [use the SSH protocol with git](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)):

```bash
$ apt install openssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub  ## copy and paste your public key to GitHub
```

Then I can clone my [dotfiles](https://github.com/leouieda/dotfiles)
repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:leouieda/dotfiles.git
```

Now my Termux terminal looks just like my Linux terminal on my laptops.

## Installing the Scipy stack

If you're from the pre-Anaconda era, you'll probably remember the frustration
of trying to `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib`.
Sadly, there is no Anaconda for Termux so we're stuck with using the system
python and `pip` to install packages.

But don't despair!
Things work more smoothly these days (if you follow the
[magic incantations](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/136)).
Sadly, the scipy library itself so far [can't be installed without significant
effort](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/471).
Even then you might not be able to do it because of all the Fortran
requirements (BLAS, LAPACK, and gfortran).
So for now, we have to make do with numpy only.

First, we must install python it self (version 3.6), the headers files, a C compiler,
and the FFTW package from Termux:

```bash
$ apt install python python-dev clang fftw
```

Now we can install numpy using pip:

```bash
$ LDFLAGS=" -lm -lcompiler_rt" pip install numpy
```

For matplotlib, we'll need to install a few more dependencies:

```bash
$ apt install freetype freetype-dev libpng libpng-dev pkg-config
$ LDFLAGS=" -lm -lcompiler_rt" pip install matplotlib
```

And for Jupyter we need to install the zmq library as well:

```bash
$ apt install libzmq libzmq-dev
$ LDFLAGS=" -lm -lcompiler_rt" pip install jupyter
```

Finally, we can get pandas:

```bash
$ LDFLAGS=" -lm -lcompiler_rt" pip install pandas
```

Now you have access to things like `ipython` on the command-line:

![IPython running inside Termux](/images/termux-ipython-numpy.png)

One thing that won't work are matplotlib plots because there is no backend for
Android.
You can, however, use `%matplotlib inline` or `%matplotlib notebook` inside
Jupyter notebooks to get the plots working.
Using `plt.savefig` without using `plt.show()` should also work.

To get a Jupyter notebook server running, so the same thing you would on any
other computer:

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

The server won't automatically open a browser but
you can copy the URL from the output and paste it into Chrome or Firefox.

## Getting comfortable

While it is possible to do some work using this setup (I wrote part of this
post on the tablet using Vim and pushing to the [website's GitHub
repo](https://github.com/leouieda/website)), it may not be the most productive
environment.
Here are a few tips for making life a little bit easier.

* Enable [extra keys (esc, ctrl, tab)](https://termux.com/touch-keyboard.html)
  to complement your touch keyboard by pressing "Volume Up" + Q. Can you
  imagine using a terminal without tab completion?
* Get a bluetooth keyboard. I bought the
  [Logitech 920-003390](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-920-003390-Tablet-Keyboard-Android/dp/B0054L8N7M/ref=sr_1_15?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1476900899&sr=1-15&keywords=Android+keyboard).
  It's not great but much better than a touch screen.
* If you want to use the touch screen, you'll need the
  [Hacker's Keyboard app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard&hl=en)
  to execute your code cells with Shift+Enter and not go crazy.
* [Remap Esc to anything else](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Avoid_the_escape_key)
  when using Vim. Esc shows the homescreen on Android and is a very frustrating
  habit to loose.

## Things that are still missing

This setup works and is way beyond what I expected to be able to accomplish
with a $200 tablet.
However, going back to pip installing numpy feels a bit like I'm back in 2010.
What I've missed the most is [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads#all)
and the [conda package manager](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/).
Having a prebuilt bundle certainly makes life a lot easier.
But I miss the conda environments the most.
I use them extensively for my projects and papers.

The scipy package. So yeah, that is still missing as well. A lot of things can
be done using numpy replacements (`numpy.fft` instead of `scipy.fftpack` etc)
though they are usually slower.

Another recent arrival that has made a huge impact on my daily work is [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/).
This project greatly democratizes conda packages.
Now anyone can build their own packages for Linux, Windows, and Mac.
It would be awesome to have some for Android as well.
Assuming that you can get conda installed, the major difficulty might
be finding a continuous integration service that runs Android and setting up
the infrastructure.

**Let me know if you try this out! Is there another setup that you use?  What
else is missing?  Do you think we'll be able to fully work like this one day?**
