title: "Websites for Earth Scientists on the academic job hunt"
date: 2018-07-26

This is a list of the websites I use to search for academic jobs in the Earth Sciences
(geophysics, geology, oceanography, meteorology, etc).
They've been very useful to me
(I found my [current position](/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc.html) through the CIG mailing list)
and I hope that this post can help others who are looking to take the next step in their
academic careers.

These sites list everything from Masters and PhD scholarships to postdoc positions and
tenure-track professorships.
Note that they are biased toward the US, Canada, Oceania, and Europe.

## Mailing lists

Sign up for these and get email updates when new opportunities are posted (most are
updated daily):

* [ES_JOBS_NET](https://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/listinfo/es_jobs_net): I get around
  10 emails from this list a day. Lately, I'm seeing a lot of positions involving
  climate change and the environment.
* [Times Higher Education unijobs](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs): Has
  very useful filters and posts job ads from many disciplines, not just Earth Science.
* [AGU Pathfinder](https://findajob.agu.org/jobs/): Official job list of the American
  Geophysical Union.
* [Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics](https://geodynamics.org/cig/about/mailing-lists/):
  Most ads are related to computational geophysics or numerical modeling but not all.
* [met-jobs](https://www.lists.rdg.ac.uk/archives/met-jobs/)
  Academic and some industry positions related to meterology and oceanography.
* [EGU Jobs](https://www.egu.eu/jobs/): The official job board for the European Geosciences Union.
  Doesn't seem to have email updates but you can subscribe using [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS).

## Job boards

These sites don't offer email updates or feeds to which you can subscribe. You'll have
to check them periodically. I leave them as pinned tabs on Firefox and look at them once
every other day.

* [EarthWorks](http://www.earthworks-jobs.com/index.shtml): This is the most
  international of all sites listed here. I see things from Asia, Africa, and South
  America, though not as often as Europe and the US.
* [GSA Job Board](http://www.geosociety.org/GSA/Publications/GSA_Today/Job_Board/GSA/GSAToday/Job_Board.aspx#pos):
  The official job board of the Geological Society of America.
