**I have been selected as part of the 2020 cohort of Fellows of the [Software
Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)!**

The Institute cultivates world-class research with software. It's based at the
universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Southampton, and Oxford in the UK.
[Their motto](https://www.software.ac.uk/about) says it all:

![Better Software, Better Research](/images/better-software-better-research.png)

The SSI has a yearly [fellowship program](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme)
to fund the organization of communities around scientific software (creating of
local user groups, workshops, hackathons, etc).
Even more importantly, they organize several events to get current and past
fellows in the same place doing awesome stuff.
I'm really looking forward to this year's
[Collaborations Workshop](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw20) (registration is
open to all, not just fellows).
I applied at the end of last year and was selected to join the
[2020 cohort of fellows](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2020-01-10-announcing-2020-software-sustainability-institute-fellows)
along with some truly amazing people.

My plan for the fellowship is to run some [Software
Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshops in Liverpool and to
develop lesson material for transitioning from coder to open-source software
maintainer (based on [our AGU workshops][/teaching/agu2018]). These workshops
will be a good way to connect with the local Python user groups. I'm also
hoping to connect with other geoscientists interested in software around the UK
and Europe at [EGU 2020](https://www.egu2020.eu/).

The application for the fellowship was the most fun I've ever had applying to
something (no tedious cover letters). We had to make a 5 minute video about
ourselves and our plans. The SSI even provided
[a guide for recording a screencast](https://software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/2019/application-video-guide)
which was really useful.
This was my first stab at making a screencast and it turns out to be a lot less
painful than I expected (apart from hearing my own recorded voice). I put [my
application video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/fT4QRbdv274) including captions
based on my script for the video.

YouTube made this really easy to do: the text is automatically synced with the
video (the joys of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), probably), so you
don't have to add time stamps or anything. You can read the transcript and find
more information at [the page for this fellowship in the Research section][/research/ssi2020].
