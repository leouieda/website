title: "Why should geologists learn how to code?"
date: 2022-03-07

I've been teaching introductory courses in programming and using programming in
my geophysics courses for a decade now.

Last week, before the second day of my 4-week "Introduction to Python for
Geoscientists" workshop, I was asked by a student why they needed to learn how
to code.
After all, they are training to become a geologist, not a geophysicist, and
couldn't see how this would be useful in their future career.
It was a fair question since, by that point, all we had seen were variables and
basic data types and operations.
Day 2 of the workshop covers loading that
with numpy and making plots (following the excellent
[Software Carpentry "Programming with Python" lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)),
which is less abstract and luckily helped show them how this skill is useful,
though for now they could still have done the same thing with Excel just as
easily.
But not being a professional geologist myself, it's hard to come up with
specific examples.
I also wanted to stay away from the argument that coding is skill that can help
you survive a downturn in geoscience by pivoting to data science.
While true, it's not particularly encouraging for first year students to be
told that they need to plan to move away from the field.

Luckily, I have access to a wide network of professional geologists who code
through the [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/) community!
So I asked them **"How has coding helped you do your job?"**

Here are some of their replies (with slight edits by me marked in `[]`).

Although I am not a geologist specifically, I did have a lot of geology
training in my BSc before choosing geophysics. My suggestions would be:

1. 3D model creation using Python interfaces \[to graphical software\] or [GemPy](https://www.gempy.org/).
1. Any graph theory application (material fluxes). \[For examples, see\] [Phillips et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2015.02.002).
1. Automated fracture or discontinuity mapping. \[For examples, see\] [Vöge et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2013.07.008) and [Prabhakaran et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsg.2021.104405).
1. \[Creating\] virtual outcrops.
1. Sped up tectonic forces and erosion.
1. You could build [geological models in Minecraft](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/discovering-geology/maps-and-resources/maps/minecraft-3d-geological-models/) (\[using their\] Python interface).
1. Maybe most importantly: **Automate the boring things.**

\[Here are\] a couple of points for motivation that I give my students:

* **Data analysis:** Automation of processing (including graph generation), reproducibility, transparency.
* **Creativity:** Find solutions \[to the problems you come across\] in a creative way.
* **Freedom:** Don't be stuck in a program that defines for you what you are able to do.
* It is a tool set that makes you more independent in the future job choice.
* I also like the general viewpoint of **computational thinking as a
  problem-solving art**. Being able to deconstruct complex problems into single
  tasks can also be transferred to non-computational problems in geology!

But maybe more directly to geology:

* More and more data now gathered and automated processing developed, also
  meaning that a lot of jobs will become obsolete. But if you are
  able to combine geological knowledge with programming, then a lot of
  opportunities open up.
* As success stories: A lot of my students found jobs **because they were able
  to combine geological knowledge with programming**. I received a super nice
  letter last year from \[a former student\] where he made it very clear how much
  that helped and opened his mind.
* I also tell the story from our industrial advisory member in the last study
  program accreditation where the advisor mentioned explicitly that the
  programming skills we teach are essential for many jobs in industry in the
  future (was from raw materials, but I am sure you could get similar quotes from
  geothermal, geotech, etc.).

Of course, the key difficulty I see for our education: we need to teach
students both geoscientific skills and knowledge and a set of tools - and there
is only limited time.
But programming is certainly a part of the standard tool set that is expected
(or seen as an advantage) for many industry jobs (or will be in the near
future).

Learning to code helped me to get a better grasp of mathematics as well as you
can focus on the math part rather then "calculating".
You can build your own tools to solve problems and avoid cumbersome tasks and
focus on the fun parts.

In industry (at least in my experience) everything is statistical. Rather then
one best estimate we try to cover the range of possible outcomes to base
decisions on. Coding allows you to do that relative easy.

But the hardest point to bring across is that \[before you start\] you don't
know all the things and ideas you will have once you can code.
You have a new set of tools at your hand and start to see all kind of problems
that could be solved.

What Florian Wellmann mentioned is right.
For me learning to code opened a new chapter in my life and how much it changed
is hard to put into words here.
**The easiest thing to describe is that it got me the job I have right now and it
was one of the most empowering experiences in my life.**

By the way, if you are **interested in geoscience and coding/technology at any
level**, the [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/) is the
best place to find your peers!

They are a registered non-profit and a legit professional society, the likes of
which you won't find anywhere is the geoscience space.
**Signing up for the Slack with over 4000 members is free** and you can also
join as a paying member to help support the community.
