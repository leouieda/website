    about: |
      <p>
      Lithosphere dynamics is approximately half of the ENVS398 module,
      the other half being the mantle and core covered by Andy Biggin.
      In my section, we take a look at the Earth's lithosphere from a
      geophysical point of view. We cover available global datasets (gravity,
      magnetics, topography/bathymetry, heat flow, seismic) and geophysical
      models that seek to explain these observations.
      </p>
      <p>
      The teaching resources include short lectures and computational
      practicals using Python to explore real data and generate model
      predictions.
      The slides for lectures are create with
      <a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a> so they can be easily kept
      under version control and shared with students in HTML form (hosted on
      GitHub Pages).
      The practicals are organized into Jupyter notebooks with annotations and
      the prerequisite code. During delivery of the practicals, I start with
      a blank version of the notebook and type out the code while I explain
      what I'm doing. This helps control my pacing and make sure students are
      engaged following along.

      <p>
      This 2-day course will cover the use of Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) in
      geodesy using UNIX shell scripting. Lectures and exercises will be given
      to teach the basic conventions of using GMT, such as plotting grids,
      images, and vector data (points, lines, polygons). Labs will include both
      processing and mapping of various data sets relevant to geodesy.
      </p>
      <p>
      The short course is taught by the GMT team:
      Paul Wessel (University of Hawaii at Manoa),
      Joaquim Luis (University of Algarve, Portugal),
      Leonardo Uieda (University of Liverpool, UK),
      Dongdong Tian (Michigan State University),
      Xiaohua Xu (Scripps Institution of Oceanography),

      <p>
      This is the second edition of our open-source best practices workshop
      at AGU. Follwing the success of the 2018 workshop, we proposed it again
      with slight modifications. This year's workshop was organized by
      <a href="https://gassmoeller.github.io/">Rene Gassmoeller</a>,
      <a href="https://lindseyjh.ca/">Lindsey Heagy</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/krischer">Lion Krischer</a>,

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
      Modern research software is the basis of scientific progress in
      geophysics by supporting data collection, data analysis, and numerical
      simulation. These codes span the range from small one-off scripts
      developed by individual researchers up to large packages with thousands
      of users. While there is increasing awareness about best programming
      practices, scientists are rarely prepared to scale their codes into team
      projects developed by larger communities. However, growing a sustainable
      software project and the community of practice that surrounds it is a
      prerequisite to make scientific software development more efficient and
      research more reproducible.
      </p>
      <p>
      The open-source community has established modern best-practices for
      developing reliable software, publishing that software, forming
      communities around the code, and finding sustainable ways to maintain
      them over time. This hands-on half-day workshop is aimed at scientists
      currently developing their own software of any size. The participants
      will apply a workflow for developing and managing open-source research
      codes following best-practices. We will discuss licensing and privacy
      considerations for open-source projects in a scientific context, briefly
      review version control with git and hosting projects online, and teach
      how to automatically test and efficiently document code. Furthermore, we
      will discuss how to grow projects and manage communities around it. The
      course material is independent of programming language or scientific
      discipline. By the end of this workshop participants will be able to
      apply the gained knowledge directly to their own projects and create more
      sustainable research software.
      </p>
      <h3>Learning objectives</h3>
      <p>Our aim with this workshop is for participants to:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
        Learn about modern best-practices for developing, testing, documenting,
        and publishing research software that promote accessibility,
        reusability, and reproducibility.

        of scientific software, defining a target audience, developing a
        project mission and vision, building a welcoming community, and
        approaching scientists uncomfortable with sharing their research
        software.

    about: |
      <p>
      This half-day workshop was taught at the 2018 AGU Fall Meeting in
      Washington DC, USA. It was organized by myself,
      <a href="https://lindseyjh.ca/">Lindsey Heagy</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/krischer">Lion Krischer</a>,
      and
      <a href="https://www.fwagner.info/">Florian Wagner</a>.
      Our goal was to help people who are already programming and want to take
      the next step towards developing open-source software.
      </p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
      Modern science increasingly relies on code, ranging from small scripts to
      workflows with many interacting parts. Reproducibility and extension of
      studies employing these codes require that they are accessible. The
      open-source community has established modern best-practices for making
      software available, usable, and maintainable. In this workshop, we will
      demonstrate a workflow for publishing research code following these
      best-practices. We will cover open-source licenses, version control,
      automated testing, documentation, and continuous integration. The
      workshop will be hands-on: participants will work to set up a project
      using sample code provided by the instructors. By the end, participants
      will have the knowledge needed to continue learning independently and
      apply these practices to their own research code. These resources can be
      applied to any programming language or scientific discipline.
      </p>
      <h3>Learning objectives</h3>
      <p>Our aim with this workshop is for participants to:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
        Gain awareness of tools available to researchers within the
        open-source ecosystem including
        <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>,
