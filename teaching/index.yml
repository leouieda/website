    github: leouieda/lithosphere
    description: ENVS398 Global Geophysics and Geodynamics • University of Liverpool
    about: |
      <p>
      Lithosphere dynamics is approximately half of the ENVS398 module,
      the other half being the mantle and core covered by Andy Biggin.
      In my section, we take a look at the Earth's lithosphere from a
      geophysical point of view. We cover available global datasets (gravity,
      magnetics, topography/bathymetry, heat flow, seismic) and geophysical
      models that seek to explain these observations.
      </p>
      <p>
      The teaching resources include short lectures and computational
      practicals using Python to explore real data and generate model
      predictions.
      The slides for lectures are create with
      <a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a> so they can be easily kept
      under version control and shared with students in HTML form (hosted on
      GitHub Pages).
      The practicals are organized into Jupyter notebooks with annotations and
      the prerequisite code. During delivery of the practicals, I start with
      a blank version of the notebook and type out the code while I explain
      what I'm doing. This helps control my pacing and make sure students are
      engaged following along.

    description: ENVS258 Environmental Geophysics • University of Liverpool
    about: |
      <p>
      Gravimetry is taught as a 2-week section of the ENVS258 module, focusing
      on the practical aspects and handling of real data (the theory is covered
      in a prerequisite module).
      My take on this was to generate simulated raw data (from an open-access
      dataset) and walk them through applying gravimeter corrections,
      calculating absolute gravity by tying to a base station, and removing
      the effects of the Normal Earth and topography (Bouguer correction).

    description: ENVS258 Environmental Geophysics • University of Liverpool
    about: |
      <p>
      The first 4 weeks of the ENVS258 module are a crash-course on satellite
      remote sensing, including multispectral images, LiDAR and DEMs, and
      InSAR.
      There is a practical focus and students learn how to manipulate these
      data using standard scientific Python tools.
      The highlight of this part of the module is the report they have to
      produce by choosing their own study region, downloading public domain
      imagery, processing it in Python, and writing up their results.
      Some of the reports are truly inspiring (I've incorporated some into
      the practicals) and they are always a pleasure to read and provide
      feedback.

    about: |
      <p>
      This is a 2h online workshop delivered for the
      <a href="https://softwareunderground.org/">Software Underground</a>'s
      yearly festival of open geoscience:
      <a href="https://transform.softwareunderground.org/">Transform</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
      Mid-ocean ridges are the places where the oceanic crust and lithosphere
      are born. They are large mountain ranges in the deep ocean, stretching
      all around the globe and with heights rivalling that of the tallest
      mountains on land. Ridges are also a key part of plate tectonics, a major
      component of the biogeochemical cycle of the oceans, and the home of
      unique biological communities.
      </p>
      <p>
      In this tutorial, we'll study the mid-ocean ridges through the lens of
      geophysics. We'll use open geophysical data (gravity, bathymetry, lithospheric
      age) and open-source Python tools to try to answer questions like: How do
      ridges stay so tall? Are they in isostatic equilibrium? Why do ocean basins
      get deeper as they age? Along the way, we'll also learn how to translate into
      code the physical models of the cooling of the lithosphere so that we can
      compare their predictions with our data.

  - title: "Let's build a geophysical inversion with Python"
    github: compgeolab/2020-aachen-inverse-problems
    description: RWTH Aachen University graduate school IRTG-2379 Modern Inverse Problems
    about: |
      <p>
      I taught this short online course (3 hours) for the Aachen graduate
      school on invitation by <a href="https://www.cgre.rwth-aachen.de/cms/CGRE/Das-Lehr-und-Forschungsgebiet/~dnyyj/Prof-Wellmann/">Prof. Florian Wellman</a>.
      I tried to give it a very hands-on spin where we attempted to code a
      non-linear gravity inversion live.
      It worked out much better than I expected!
      </p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
      Inverse problems abound in geophysics. It is the primary way in which we
      investigate the subsurface of the Earth, which is largely inaccessible to
      us beyond the first dozen or so kilometers. From measurements acquired on
      land, sea, air, and from space, geophysicists tease out the inner
      structure of the Earth - from a few meters to thousands of kilometers
      deep in the inner core. Observations of disturbances in the Earth's
      gravity field are one of the key elements used by geophysicists to
      investigate the crust-mantle interface, the large-scale structure of
      sedimentary basins (which are reservoirs for water and hydrocarbons), and
      even the mass balance of the world's ice sheets. However, the gravity
      inverse problem is particularly challenging due to the physics of
      potential fields. Unique solutions are difficult to come by and only
      exist under strict assumptions, which often don't hold for real world
      scenarios. For these problems, regularization plays a critical role and
      has been the focus of much research in the past 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
      In this tutorial, we will work together to solve a 2D gravity inverse
      problem in Python. Our code will estimate the shape of a sedimentary
      basin from gravity observations. This non-linear inverse problem will
      allow us to visually explore the effects of different types of
      regularization from a geometric perspective (smoothness, equality
      constraints, and more). We will discuss the challenges involved in real
      world applications and the difficulties of quantifying the uncertainty in
      the solutions. The main goal of this tutorial is to impart theoretical
      and practical skills that can be easily transfered to other domains.

    about: |
      <p>
      This is the second edition of our open-source best practices workshop
      at AGU. Follwing the success of the 2018 workshop, we proposed it again
      with slight modifications. This year's workshop was organized by
      <a href="https://gassmoeller.github.io/">Rene Gassmoeller</a>,
      <a href="https://lindseyjh.ca/">Lindsey Heagy</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/krischer">Lion Krischer</a>,

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
      Modern research software is the basis of scientific progress in
      geophysics by supporting data collection, data analysis, and numerical
      simulation. These codes span the range from small one-off scripts
      developed by individual researchers up to large packages with thousands
      of users. While there is increasing awareness about best programming
      practices, scientists are rarely prepared to scale their codes into team
      projects developed by larger communities. However, growing a sustainable
      software project and the community of practice that surrounds it is a
      prerequisite to make scientific software development more efficient and
      research more reproducible.
      </p>
      <p>
      The open-source community has established modern best-practices for
      developing reliable software, publishing that software, forming
      communities around the code, and finding sustainable ways to maintain
      them over time. This hands-on half-day workshop is aimed at scientists
      currently developing their own software of any size. The participants
      will apply a workflow for developing and managing open-source research
      codes following best-practices. We will discuss licensing and privacy
      considerations for open-source projects in a scientific context, briefly
      review version control with git and hosting projects online, and teach
      how to automatically test and efficiently document code. Furthermore, we
      will discuss how to grow projects and manage communities around it. The
      course material is independent of programming language or scientific
      discipline. By the end of this workshop participants will be able to
      apply the gained knowledge directly to their own projects and create more
      sustainable research software.
      </p>

      This half-day workshop was taught at the 2018 AGU Fall Meeting in
      Washington DC, USA. It was organized by myself,
      <a href="https://lindseyjh.ca/">Lindsey Heagy</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/krischer">Lion Krischer</a>,
      and
      <a href="https://www.fwagner.info/">Florian Wagner</a>.
      Our goal was to help people who are already programming and want to take
      the next step towards developing open-source software.
      </p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
      Modern science increasingly relies on code, ranging from small scripts to
      workflows with many interacting parts. Reproducibility and extension of
      studies employing these codes require that they are accessible. The
      open-source community has established modern best-practices for making
      software available, usable, and maintainable. In this workshop, we will
      demonstrate a workflow for publishing research code following these
      best-practices. We will cover open-source licenses, version control,
      automated testing, documentation, and continuous integration. The
      workshop will be hands-on: participants will work to set up a project
      using sample code provided by the instructors. By the end, participants
      will have the knowledge needed to continue learning independently and
      apply these practices to their own research code. These resources can be
      applied to any programming language or scientific discipline.
