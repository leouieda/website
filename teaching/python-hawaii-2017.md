# About

This was a 3-day workshop (17, 19, 20 of April 2017) held at the Department of Geology and Geophysics of
the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
It covered the basics of computer programming with Python, starting from the
very beginning.
The workshop had no prerequisites and it was a bit challenging to balance
people who have never programmed before with veteran programmers who are new to
Python.

All material used is stored in the Github repository and can be freely reused.

I wrote a blog post about my thoughts on the workshop and the feedback that I
received from the participants:
