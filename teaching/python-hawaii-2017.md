# About

This is a 3-day workshop held at the Department of Geology and Geophysics of
the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
It covers the basics of computer programming with Python, starting from the
very beginning.
The workshop had no prerequisites and it was a bit challenging to balance
people who have never programmed before with veteran programmers who are new to
Python.


# Goals

I wanted this to be a hands-on workshop of the basic concepts needed to use
Python for research. Participants who complete the workshop should be able to
use Python to gather data from one or more files, process the data, run an
analysis, make publication quality figures, and save the output.


# Who attended

> Show some graphs and comments about the workshop participants.


# Lessons learned

> A bit about what worked and what didn't work. Summary of feedback from
> participants.

I experimented with using Google Docs for shared class notes (links in the
Github repository).
