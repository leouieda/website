# About

*Tesseroids* is a collection of command-line programs for modeling the
gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor. Tesseroids supports
models and computation grids in Cartesian and spherical coordinates.

The geometric element used in the modeling processes is a spherical prism, also
called a tesseroid. Tesseroids also contains programs for modeling using right
rectangular prisms, both in Cartesian and spherical coordinates.

I started working on *Tesseroids* in 2008 for my
[Bachelor's degree thesis][/about/bachelors].
Since then, the software has been through many revisions.

The paper "[/papers/paper-tesseroids-2016]" describes the algorithms behind
[version 1.2.0](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16033) of the software.
This paper became a chapter of [my PhD thesis][/about/phd].
