# About

Fatiando a Terra (Portuguese for Slicing the Earth) is an open-source Python
toolkit for modeling and inversion in geophysics. It provides an easy and
flexible way to perform and implement geophysical data analysis.

I've started development of Fatiando in 2010 during my Masters degree at the
Observat√≥rio Nacional, Brazil.
I now use it daily for my research and teaching.
Fatiando has grown and is now a **community developed** project, with
contributors from different countries.

Most recent papers published by the [PINGA lab](http://www.pinga-lab.org) use
it in some way.
My [Geophysics courses](/teaching) use Fatiando and
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to provide students with interactive
examples and synthetic data.

Fatiando was featured in the [89th Boletim SBGf (PDF in
Portuguese)](http://sys2.sbgf.org.br/portal/images/stories/Arquivos/Boletim_89-2014.pdf).
