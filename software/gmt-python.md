# About

Is started building the GMT/Python interface in 2017 as part of my
[postdoc at the University of Hawaii][/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc] with
[Prof Paul Wessel](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel).
Work is still in early stages but there is a minimum working example on the
website.
The library is **Python 3 only and requires the latest development build of
GMT** (trunk of the SVN repository).
We're striving for comprehensive test coverage and documentation.

We have a [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/GenericMappingTools/gmt-python)
if you want to get touch.
We'll need all the help we can get wrapping [the many GMT
modules](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/latest/index.html).

I gave a [talk about GMT/Python at Scipy 2017][/talks/scipy2017]:
