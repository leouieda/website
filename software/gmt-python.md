# About

I started building the GMT/Python interface in 2017 as part of my
[postdoc at the University of Hawaii][/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc] with
[Prof Paul Wessel](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel).
Work is still in early stages but there is a minimum working example on the
website.
The library is **Python 3 only and requires the latest development build of
GMT** (trunk of the SVN repository).
We're striving for comprehensive test coverage and documentation.
