## Nēnē: A no-frills static site generator

<div class="row gy-5 gx-5 align-items-start justify-content-center">
<div class="col-md-9">

Nēnē is the side project that I use to blow off steam and experiment with
Python without the pressures of backwards compatibility and testing that my
research software work requires.
It's also what I use to build this website.

The name is a nod to [Urubu](https://github.com/jandecaluwe/urubu), which I
used to build my website before, and the
[unforgettable time I spent in Hawai'i](/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc.html).

## Fatiando a Terra

<div class="row gy-5 gx-5 align-items-start justify-content-center">
<div class="col-md-9">

Fatiando provides Python libraries for data processing, modeling, and inversion
across the Geosciences.
It is built by a community of geoscientists and software developers with a
passion for well-designed tools and helping our peers.

I've been working on Fatiando since around 2010 when I started my MSc.
It's been the main focus of my career and it permeates all aspects of my work,
from research to teaching.

## Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)

<div class="row gy-5 gx-5 align-items-start justify-content-center">
<div class="col-md-9">

GMT is one of the most widely used open-source software projects in the Earth
Sciences. It's been around for decades and is to many the very symbol of
open-source. I had the pleasure to
[join the GMT team](/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc.html) during my postdoc working
on [PyGMT](https://www.pygmt.org).

Recently, my contributions to GMT and PyGMT have been more on the community and
guidance side than actual coding.
Thankfully, they don't really need me for the coding parts.

## Tesseroids

<div class="row gy-5 gx-5 align-items-start justify-content-center">
<div class="col-md-9">

A collection of command-line programs for modelling the gravitational attraction
of spherical prisms (tesseroids).

This was my first open-source project. I started working on Tesseroids as part
of my BSc dissertation project with
[Naomi Ussami](http://lattes.cnpq.br/6704246490515612) and
[Carla Braitenberg](https://www2.units.it/braitenberg/).
Through Tesseroids, I learned about documentation, unit tests,
cross-compilation, version control, and more.
