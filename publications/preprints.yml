    Very small magnetic particles in rocks and other materials can store
    information about what the Earth’s magnetic field was like in the past. But
    not all particles are good recorders of this magnetic information, and some
    may have recorded different overlapping directions and strengths. So it is
    important to measure each particle separately in order to identify and
    separate the good recorders from the bad ones. A device called a "quantum
    diamond microscope" is able to measure the magnetic field near the surface
    of a rock sample at microscopic scale. We propose a new method for
    processing data from this microscope that is able to find out the
    individual magnetizations of large amounts of small magnetic particles
    automatically. We created a computer program to execute the method, which
    calculates the 3D position and magnetization of each particle using the
    simple model of a magnetic dipole. We tested the method on simulated data,
    using fake magnetic particles for which we know the correct magnetization
    and position, and real data, both of which showed good results in most
    cases. The method we created has the potential to enable the widespread
    study of the magnetism of natural materials with more detail than before.

    The idea for this work came from combining the group's expertise in applied
    geophysics and paleomagnetism. This is the first contribution from Gelson
    F. Souza Junior's PhD project.

    A recent editorial in Nature Methods, "Giving Software its Due",
    described challenges related to the development of research software and
    highlighted, in particular, the challenge of software publication and
    citation. Here, we call attention to a system that we have developed that
    enables community-driven software review, publication, and
    citation: The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open-source
    project and an open access journal that provides a light-weight
    publishing process for research software. Focused on and based in open
    platforms and on a community of contributors, JOSS evidently satisfies a
    pressing need, having already published more than 500 articles in
    approximately three years of existence.
  note: |
    This correspondence was written by the editorial board of the
    <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of Open Source Software</a> in
    response to the Nature Methods editorial
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0350-x">"Giving Software its Due"</a>.
    It was not accepted as a comment on the editorial so we published it as a
    preprint instead.
