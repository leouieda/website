  abstract: |
    The equivalent source technique is a powerful and widely used method for
    processing gravity and magnetic data. Nevertheless, its major drawback is
    the large computational cost in terms of processing time and computer
    memory. We present two techniques for reducing the computational cost of
    equivalent source processing: block-averaging source locations and the
    gradient-boosted equivalent source algorithm. Through block-averaging,
    we reduce the number of source coefficients that must be estimated
    while retaining the minimum desired resolution in the final processed
    data. With the gradient boosting method, we estimate the sources
    coefficients in small batches along overlapping windows, allowing us to
    reduce the computer memory requirements arbitrarily to conform to the
    constraints of the available hardware. We show that the combination of
    block-averaging and gradient-boosted equivalent sources is capable of
    producing accurate interpolations through tests against synthetic data.
    Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by gridding a
    gravity dataset covering Australia with over 1.7 million observations
    using a modest personal computer.

  abstract: |
    Scientific software is usually created to acquire, analyze, model, and
    visualize data. As such, many software libraries include sample datasets
    in their distributions for use in documentation, tests, benchmarks, and
    workshops. A common approach is to include smaller datasets in the GitHub
    repository directly and package them with the source and binary
    distributions (e.g., scikit-learn and scikit-image do this). As data
    files increase in size, it becomes unfeasible to store them in GitHub
    repositories. Thus, larger datasets require writing code to download the
    files from a remote server to the user's computer. The same problem is
    faced by scientists using version control to manage their research
    projects. While downloading a data file over HTTPS can be done easily
    with modern Python libraries, it is not trivial to manage a set of files,
    keep them updated, and check for corruption. For example, scikit-learn,
    Cartopy, and PyVista all include code dedicated to this particular task.
    Instead of scientists and library authors recreating the same code, it
    would be best to have a minimalistic and easy to set up tool for fetching
    and maintaining data files.
    Pooch is a Python library that fills this gap. It manages a data registry
    (containing file names, SHA-256 cryptographic hashes, and download URLs) by
    downloading files from one or more remote servers and storing them in a local
    data cache. Pooch is written in pure Python and has minimal dependencies. It
    can be easily installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and conda-forge on
    a wide range of Python versions: 2.7 (up to Pooch 0.6.0) and from 3.5 to 3.8.

    <a href="http://www.fatiando.org/pooch">Pooch</a> v0.7.1,

  abstract: |
    The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software is ubiquitous in the Earth and
    Ocean sciences. As a cross-platform tool producing high quality maps and
    figures, it is used by tens of thousands of scientists around the world.
    The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s,
    despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning
    curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike.
    Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break
    compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT
    version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new "modern mode" to
    complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls
    "classic mode". GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended
    upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage
    of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used
    global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw
    subplots, place insets, and create animations.
  note: |
    This paper marks the release of GMT version 6. Most of the work done for
    this release had the goal of reducing barriers to entry for new users.
    The user experience as a whole has been improved and these changes are
    the foundation for my work on PyGMT. The development of the new modern
    mode was funded by our NSF EarthScope grant.

    Gravitational field calculation in spherical coordinates using variable

  abstract: |
    We present a new methodology to compute the gravitational fields
    generated by tesseroids (spherical prisms) whose density varies with
    depth according to an arbitrary continuous function. It approximates the
    gravitational fields through the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature along with two
    discretization algorithms that automatically control its accuracy by
    adaptively dividing the tesseroid into smaller ones. The first one is a
    preexisting two dimensional adaptive discretization algorithm that
    reduces the errors due to the distance between the tesseroid and the
    computation point. The second is a new density-based discretization
    algorithm that decreases the errors introduced by the variation of the
    density function with depth. The amount of divisions made by each
    algorithm is indirectly controlled by two parameters: the distance-size
    ratio and the delta ratio. We have obtained analytical solutions for a
    spherical shell with radially variable density and compared them to the
    results of the numerical model for linear, exponential, and sinusoidal
    density functions. These comparisons allowed us to obtain optimal values
    for the distance-size and delta ratios that yield an accuracy of 0.1% of
    the analytical solutions. The resulting optimal values of distance-size
    ratio for the gravitational potential and its gradient are 1 and 2.5,
    respectively. The density-based discretization algorithm produces no
    discretizations in the linear density case, but a delta ratio of 0.1 is
    needed for the exponential and the sinusoidal density functions. These
    values can be extrapolated to cover most common use cases. However, the
    distance-size and delta ratios can be configured by the user to increase
    the accuracy of the results at the expense of computational speed.
    Lastly, we apply this new methodology to model the Neuquén Basin, a
    foreland basin in Argentina with a maximum depth of over 5000 m, using an
    exponential density function.

    Efficient 3D large-scale forward-modeling and inversion of gravitational

  abstract: |
    An efficient forward modeling algorithm for calculation of gravitational
    fields in spherical coordinates is developed for 3D large‐scale gravity
    inversion problems. 3D Gauss‐Legendre quadrature (GLQ) is used to
    calculate the gravitational fields of mass distributions discretized into
    tesseroids. Equivalence relations in the kernel matrix of the
    forward‐modeling are exploited to decrease storage and computation time.
    The numerical tests demonstrate that the computation time of the proposed
    algorithm is reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude, and the
    memory requirement is reduced by N'λ times compared with the traditional
    GLQ method, where N'λ is the number of the model elements in the
    longitudinal direction. These significant improvements in computational
    efficiency and storage make it possible to calculate and store the dense
    Jacobian matrix in 3D large‐scale gravity inversions. The equivalence
    relations can be applied to the Taylor series method or combined with the
    adaptive discretization to ensure high accuracy. To further illustrate
    the capability of the algorithm, we present a regional synthetic example.
    The inverted results show density distributions consistent with the
    actual model. The computation took about 6.3 hours and 0.88 GB of memory
    compared with about a dozen days and 245.86 GB for the traditional 3D GLQ
    method. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to the gravity field
    derived from the latest lunar gravity model GL1500E. 3D density
    distributions of the Imbrium and Serenitatis basins are obtained, and
    high‐density bodies are found at the depths 10‐60 km, likely indicating a
    significant uplift of the high‐density mantle beneath the two mascon
    basins.

  abstract: |
    Verde is a Python library for gridding spatial data using different
    Green's functions. It differs from the radial basis functions in
    <code>scipy.interpolate</code> by providing an API inspired by
    scikit-learn. The Verde API should be familiar to scikit-learn users but
    is tweaked to work with spatial data, which has Cartesian or geographic
    coordinates and multiple data components instead of an <code>X</code>
    feature matrix and <code>y</code> label vector. The library also includes
    more specialized Green's functions, utilities for trend estimation and
    data decimation (which are often required prior to gridding), and more.
    Some of these interpolation and data processing methods already exist in
    the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), a command-line program popular in the
    Earth Sciences. However, there are no model selection tools in GMT and it
    can be difficult to separate parts of the processing that are done
    internally by its modules. Verde is designed to be modular, easily
    extended, and integrated into the scientific Python ecosystem. It can be
    used to implement new interpolation methods by subclassing the
    <code>verde.base.BaseGridder</code> class, requiring only the
    implementation of the new Green's function. For example, it is currently
    being used to develop a method for interpolation of 3-component GPS data.

  abstract: |
    Estimating the relief of the Moho from gravity data is a computationally
    intensive non-linear inverse problem. What is more, the modeling must take the
    Earths curvature into account when the study area is of regional scale or
    greater. We present a regularized non-linear gravity inversion method that has
    a low computational footprint and employs a spherical Earth approximation. To
    achieve this, we combine the highly efficient Bott's method with smoothness
    regularization and a discretization of the anomalous Moho into tesseroids
    (spherical prisms). The computational efficiency of our method is attained by
    harnessing the fact that all matrices involved are sparse. The inversion
    results are controlled by three hyper-parameters: the regularization parameter,
    the anomalous Moho density-contrast, and the reference Moho depth. We
    estimate the regularization parameter using the method of hold-out
    cross-validation. Additionally, we estimate the density-contrast and the
    reference depth using knowledge of the Moho depth at certain points. We apply
    the proposed method to estimate the Moho depth for the South American
    continent using satellite gravity data and seismological data. The final Moho
    model is in accordance with previous gravity-derived models and seismological
    data. The misfit to the gravity and seismological data is worse in the Andes
    and best in oceanic areas, central Brazil and Patagonia, and along the
    Atlantic coast. Similarly to previous results, the model suggests a thinner
    crust of 30-35 km under the Andean foreland basins. Discrepancies with the
    seismological data are greatest in the Guyana Shield, the central Solimões
    and Amazonas Basins, the Paraná Basin, and the Borborema province. These
    differences suggest the existence of crustal or mantle density anomalies that
    were unaccounted for during gravity data processing.

  abstract: |
    We present the open-source software Tesseroids, a set of command-line
    programs to perform the forward modeling of gravitational fields in
    spherical coordinates.  The software is implemented in the C programming
    language and uses tesseroids (spherical prisms) for the discretization of
    the subsurface mass distribution.  The gravitational fields of tesseroids
    are calculated numerically using the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GLQ).  We
    have improved upon an adaptive discretization algorithm to guarantee the
    accuracy of the GLQ integration.  Our implementation of adaptive
    discretization uses a "stack" based algorithm instead of recursion to
    achieve more control over execution errors and corner cases.  The
    algorithm is controlled by a scalar value called the distance-size ratio
    (D) that determines the accuracy of the integration as well as the
    computation time.  We determined optimal values of D for the
    gravitational potential, gravitational acceleration, and gravity gradient
    tensor by comparing the computed tesseroids effects with those of a
    homogeneous spherical shell.  The values required for a maximum relative
    error of 0.1% of the shell effects are D = 1 for the gravitational
    potential, D = 1.5 for the gravitational acceleration, and D = 8 for the
    gravity gradients.  Contrary to previous assumptions, our results show
    that the potential and its first and second derivatives require different
    values of D to achieve the same accuracy. These values were incorporated
    as defaults in the software.

    Airborne gravity gradiometry data have been recently used in mining
    surveys to map the 3D geometry of ore deposits. This task can be achieved
    by different gravity-gradient inversion methods, many of which use a
    voxel-based discretization of the Earth's subsurface. To produce a unique
    and stable solution, an inversion method introduces particular
    constraints. One constraining inversion introduces a depth-weighting
    function in the first-order Tikhonov regularization imposing a smoothing
    on the density-contrast distributions that are not restricted to
    near-surface regions. Another gravity-gradient inversion, the method of
    planting anomalous densities, imposes compactness and sharp boundaries on
    the density-contrast distributions. We used these two inversion methods
    to invert the airborne gravity-gradient data over the iron-ore deposit at
    the southern flank of the Gandarela syncline in Quadrilátero Ferrífero
    (Brazil). Because these methods differ from each other in the particular
    constraint used, the estimated 3D density-contrast distributions reveal
    different geologic features of ore deposit. The depth-weighting smoothing
    inversion reveals variable dip directions along the strike of the
    retrieved iron-ore body. The planting anomalous density inversion
    estimates a compact iron-ore mass with a single density contrast, which
    reveals a variable volume of the iron ore along its strike increasing
    towards the hinge zone of the Gandarela syncline which is the zone of
    maximum compression. The combination of the geologic features inferred
    from each estimate leads to a synergistic effect, revealing that the
    iron-ore deposit is strongly controlled by the Gandarela syncline.

  abstract: |
    We have developed a fast total-field anomaly inversion to estimate the
    magnetization direction of multiple sources with approximately spherical
    shapes and known centres. Our method is an overdetermined inverse problem
    that can be applied to interpret multiple sources with different but
    homogeneous magnetization directions. It requires neither the prior
    computation of any transformation-like reduction to the pole nor the use
    of regularly spaced data on a horizontal grid. The method contains
    flexibility to be implemented as a linear or non-linear inverse problem,
    which results, respectively, in a least-squares or robust estimate of the
    components of the magnetization vector of the sources. Applications to
    synthetic data show the robustness of our method against interfering
    anomalies and errors in the location of the sources' centre. Besides, we
    show the feasibility of applying the upward continuation to interpret
    non-spherical sources. Applications to field data over the Goiás alkaline
    province (GAP), Brazil, show the good performance of our method in
    estimating geologically meaningful magnetization directions. The results
    obtained for a region of the GAP, near to the alkaline complex of
    Diorama, suggest the presence of non-outcropping sources marked by strong
    remanent magnetization with inclination and declination close to −70.35
    and −19.81°, respectively. This estimated magnetization direction leads
    to predominantly positive reduced-to-the-pole anomalies, even for other
    region of the GAP, in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás.
    These results show that the non-outcropping sources near to the alkaline
    complex of Diorama have almost the same magnetization direction of those
    ones in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás, strongly
    suggesting that these sources have been emplaced in the crust within
    almost the same geological time interval.

    Imaging iron ore from the Quadrilátero Ferrífero (Brazil) using

  abstract: |
    The Quadrilátero Ferrífero in southeastern Brazil hosts one of the
    largest concentrations of lateritic iron ore deposits in the world. Our
    study area is over the southern flank of the Gandarela syncline which is
    one of the regional synclines of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero. The
    Gandarela syncline is considered the Brazilian megastructure with the
    highest perspectives for iron ore exploration. Most of the iron-ore
    deposits from the Quadrilátero Ferrífero are non-outcropping bodies
    hosted in the oxidized, metamorphosed and heterogeneously deformed banded
    iron formations. Therefore, the assessment of the 3D geometry of the
    iron-ore body is of the utmost importance for estimating reserves and
    production development planning. We carried out a quantitative
    interpretation of the iron-ore deposit of the southern flank of the
    Gandarela syncline using a 3D inversion of airborne gravity-gradient data
    to estimate the shape of the iron-ore mineralization. The retrieved body
    is characterized by a high-density zone associated with the
    northeast-elongated iron formation. The thickness and the width of the
    retrieved iron-ore body vary along its strike increasing southwestward.
    The presence of a large volume of iron ore in the southwest portion of
    the study area may be due to the hinge zone of the Gandarela syncline,
    which is the zone of maximum compression. Our estimated iron-ore mass
    reveals variable dip directions. In the southernmost, central and
    northernmost portions of the study area, the estimated iron body dips,
    respectively, inwards, vertically and outwards with respect to the
    syncline axis. Previous geological mapping indicated continuous
    mineralization. However, our result suggests a quasi-continuous iron-ore
    body. In the central part of the study area, the estimated iron-ore body
    is segmented into two parts. This breakup may be related to the
    northwest-trending faults, which are perpendicular to the
    northeast-trending axis of the Gandarela syncline. Our estimated iron-ore
    mass agrees reasonably well with the information provided from the
    lithologic logging data of drill holes. In this geophysical study, the
    estimated iron-ore reserves are approximately 3 billion tons.

    Estimating the nature and the horizontal and vertical positions of 3D

  pdf: ../pdf/euler-plateau-2013.pdf
  abstract: |
    We have developed a new method that drastically reduces the number of the
    source location estimates in Euler deconvolution to only one per anomaly.
    Our method employs the analytical estimators of the base level and of the
    horizontal and vertical source positions in Euler deconvolution as a
    function of the x- and y-coordinates of the observations. By assuming any
    tentative structural index (defining the geometry of the sources), our
    method automatically locates plateaus, on the maps of the horizontal
    coordinate estimates, indicating consistent estimates that are very close
    to the true corresponding coordinates. These plateaus are located in the
    neighborhood of the highest values of the anomaly and show a contrasting
    behavior with those estimates that form inclined planes at the anomaly
    borders. The plateaus are automatically located on the maps of the
    horizontal coordinate estimates by fitting a first-degree polynomial to
    these estimates in a moving-window scheme spanning all estimates. The
    positions where the angular coefficient estimates are closest to zero
    identify the plateaus of the horizontal coordinate estimates. The sample
    means of these horizontal coordinate estimates are the best horizontal
    location estimates. After mapping each plateau, our method takes as the
    best structural index the one that yields the minimum correlation between
    the total-field anomaly and the estimated base level over each plateau.
    By using the estimated structural index for each plateau, our approach
    extracts the vertical coordinate estimates over the corresponding
    plateau. The sample means of these estimates are the best depth location
    estimates in our method. When applied to synthetic data, our method
    yielded good results if the bodies produce weak- and mid-interfering
    anomalies. A test on real data over intrusions in the Goiás Alkaline
    Province, Brazil, retrieved sphere-like sources suggesting 3D bodies.

  pdf: ../pdf/polynomial-eqlayer-2013.pdf
  abstract: |
    We have developed a new cost-effective method for processing
    large-potential-field data sets via the equivalent-layer technique. In
    this approach, the equivalent layer is divided into a regular grid of
    equivalent-source windows. Inside each window, the physical-property
    distribution is described by a bivariate polynomial. Hence, the
    physical-property distribution within the equivalent layer is assumed to
    be a piecewise polynomial function defined on a set of equivalent-source
    windows. We perform any linear transformation of a large set of data as
    follows. First, we estimate the polynomial coefficients of all
    equivalent-source windows by using a linear regularized inversion.
    Second, we transform the estimated polynomial coefficients of all windows
    into the physical-property distribution within the whole equivalent
    layer. Finally, we premultiply this distribution by the matrix of Green's
    functions associated with the desired transformation to obtain the
    transformed data. The regularized inversion deals with a linear system of
    equations with dimensions based on the total number of polynomial
    coefficients within all equivalent-source windows. This contrasts with
    the classical approach of directly estimating the physical-property
    distribution within the equivalent layer, which leads to a system based
    on the number of data. Because the number of data is much larger than the
    number of polynomial coefficients, the proposed polynomial representation
    of the physical-property distribution within an equivalent layer
    drastically reduces the number of parameters to be estimated. By
    comparing the total number of floating-point operations required to
    estimate an equivalent layer via our method with the classical approach,
    both formulated with Cholesky's decomposition, we can verify that the
    computation time required for building the linear system and for solving
    the linear inverse problem can be reduced by as many as three and four
    orders of magnitude, respectively. Applications to synthetic and real
    data show that our method performs the standard linear transformations of
    potential-field data accurately.

  abstract: |
    We have developed a new gravity gradient inversion method for estimating
    a 3D density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of rectangular
    prisms. Our method consists of an iterative algorithm that does not
    require the solution of an equation system. Instead, the solution grows
    systematically around user-specified prismatic elements, called “seeds,”
    with given density contrasts. Each seed can be assigned a different
    density-contrast value, allowing the interpretation of multiple sources
    with different density contrasts and that produce interfering signals. In
    real world scenarios, some sources might not be targeted for the
    interpretation. Thus, we developed a robust procedure that neither
    requires the isolation of the signal of the targeted sources prior to the
    inversion nor requires substantial prior information about the
    nontargeted sources. In our iterative algorithm, the estimated sources
    grow by the accretion of prisms in the periphery of the current estimate.
    In addition, only the columns of the sensitivity matrix corresponding to
    the prisms in the periphery of the current estimate are needed for the
    computations. Therefore, the individual columns of the sensitivity matrix
    can be calculated on demand and deleted after an accretion takes place,
    greatly reducing the demand for computer memory and processing time.
    Tests on synthetic data show the ability of our method to correctly
    recover the geometry of the targeted sources, even when interfering
    signals produced by nontargeted sources are present. Inverting the data
    from an airborne gravity gradiometry survey flown over the iron ore
    province of Quadrilátero Ferrífero, southeastern Brazil, we estimated a
    compact iron ore body that is in agreement with geologic information and
    previous interpretations.
