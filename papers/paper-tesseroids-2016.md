# About

This paper is a chapter of my PhD thesis.
It describes the algorithms used in version 1.2.0 of the open-source
software [/software/tesseroids].
The software is a suite of C coded command-line programs that calculate the
gravitational field of a tesseroid (spherical prism) model.
There is also a separate Python implementation of the same algorithm in the
`fatiando.gravmag.tesseroid` module of the open-source library
[/software/fatiando] (introduced in version 0.3).

# Abstract

We present the open-source software Tesseroids, a set of command-line programs
to perform the forward modeling of gravitational fields in spherical
coordinates.  The software is implemented in the C programming language and
uses tesseroids (spherical prisms) for the discretization of the subsurface
mass distribution.  The gravitational fields of tesseroids are calculated
numerically using the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GLQ).  We have improved upon
an adaptive discretization algorithm to guarantee the accuracy of the GLQ
integration.  Our implementation of adaptive discretization uses a "stack"
based algorithm instead of recursion to achieve more control over execution
errors and corner cases.  The algorithm is controlled by a scalar value called
the distance-size ratio (D) that determines the accuracy of the integration as
well as the computation time.  We determined optimal values of D for the
gravitational potential, gravitational acceleration, and gravity gradient
tensor by comparing the computed tesseroids effects with those of a homogeneous
spherical shell.  The values required for a maximum relative error of 0.1% of
the shell effects are D = 1 for the gravitational potential, D = 1.5 for the
gravitational acceleration, and D = 8 for the gravity gradients.  Contrary to
previous assumptions, our results show that the potential and its first and
second derivatives require different values of D to achieve the same accuracy.
These values were incorporated as defaults in the software.
