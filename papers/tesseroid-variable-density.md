# About

This paper builds upon [my work on Tesseroids][/papers/paper-tesseroids-2016] and
extends the methodology to work for depth-variable densities. Santiago, a PhD student at
[Universidad Nacional de San Juan](http://www.unsj.edu.ar/) whom I co-advise, led this
project. He did most of the work and a large part of the writing of the paper.

# Abstract

We present a new methodology to compute the gravitational fields generated by tesseroids
(spherical prisms) whose density varies with depth according to an arbitrary continuous
function. It approximates the gravitational fields through the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature
along with two discretization algorithms that automatically control its accuracy by
adaptively dividing the tesseroid into smaller ones. The first one is a preexisting two
dimensional adaptive discretization algorithm that reduces the errors due to the
distance between the tesseroid and the computation point. The second is a new
density-based discretization algorithm that decreases the errors introduced by the
variation of the density function with depth. The amount of divisions made by each
algorithm is indirectly controlled by two parameters: the distance-size ratio and the
delta ratio. We have obtained analytical solutions for a spherical shell with radially
variable density and compared them to the results of the numerical model for linear,
exponential, and sinusoidal density functions. These comparisons allowed us to obtain
optimal values for the distance-size and delta ratios that yield an accuracy of 0.1% of
the analytical solutions. The resulting optimal values of distance-size ratio for the
gravitational potential and its gradient are 1 and 2.5, respectively. The density-based
discretization algorithm produces no discretizations in the linear density case, but a
delta ratio of 0.1 is needed for the exponential and the sinusoidal density functions.
These values can be extrapolated to cover most common use cases. However, the
distance-size and delta ratios can be configured by the user to increase the accuracy of
the results at the expense of computational speed. Lastly, we apply this new methodology
to model the Neuquén Basin, a foreland basin in Argentina with a maximum depth of over
5000 m, using an exponential density function.
