# About

This correspondence was written by the editorial team of the
[Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) in response to the
Nature Methods editorial
["Giving Software its Due"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0350-x).
It was not accepted as a comment on the editorial so we published it as a preprint
instead.

# Abstract

A recent editorial in Nature Methods, "Giving Software its Due", described challenges
related to the development of research software and highlighted, in particular, the
challenge of software publication and citation. Here, we call attention to a system that
we have developed that enables community-driven software review, publication, and
citation: The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open-source project and an
open access journal that provides a light-weight publishing process for research
software. Focused on and based in open platforms and on a community of contributors,
JOSS evidently satisfies a pressing need, having already published more than 500
articles in approximately three years of existence.
