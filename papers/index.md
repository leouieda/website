Publications marked with a {{ai("open-access")}} are
[open-access (OA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access).
I have made available links for you to download free PDFs from all non-OA
publications.
Many papers include links to accompanying source-code repositories and
supplementary material hosted on [figshare](http://figshare.com) or
[Zenodo](http://zenodo.org).
