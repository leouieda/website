# About

This paper is a chapter of my [PhD thesis][/about/phd].
It describes a new gravity inversion method to estimate the depth of the
crust-mantle interface (the Moho).
The inversion uses a spherical Earth approximation by discretizing the Earth
into tesseroids (spherical prisms).
The forward modeling method used is described in the paper
[/papers/paper-tesseroids-2016].
We applied the inversion to estimate the Moho depth for South America.

The main result from this publication is the gravity-derived Moho depth model
for South America and the differences between it and seismological estimates
of [Assumpção et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2012.11.014).
These differences allow us to know where the gravity-derived model can be trusted and where there might be unaccounted sources in the gravity data.

# Open-source implementation

The inversion method proposed here is implemented in the Python programming
language.
The code uses the forward modeling and inversion packages of the library
(https://www.fatiando.org).

You'll find the source code, input data, and instructions to produce the
results from the paper on the Github repository. There should be enough
information for you to produce all figures of the paper.


# Running the code online

You can run the Jupyter notebooks online without installing anything
thanks to the awesome free [Binder](http://mybinder.org/) web service.
Follow the link below and open any notebook in the `code` folder. Beware that
the CRUST1.0 synthetic and the South American Moho results will take hours or
days to run.

# Abstract

Estimating the relief of the Moho from gravity data is a computationally
intensive non-linear inverse problem.  What is more, the modeling must
take the Earths curvature into account when the study area is of regional
scale or greater.  We present a regularized non-linear gravity inversion
method that has a low computational footprint and employs a spherical
Earth approximation.  To achieve this, we combine the highly efficient
Bott's method with smoothness regularization and a discretization of the
anomalous Moho into tesseroids (spherical prisms).  The computational
efficiency of our method is attained by harnessing the fact that all
matrices involved are sparse.  The inversion results are controlled by
three hyper-parameters: the regularization parameter, the anomalous Moho
density-contrast, and the reference Moho depth.  We estimate the
regularization parameter using the method of hold-out cross-validation.
Additionally, we estimate the density-contrast and the reference depth
using knowledge of the Moho depth at certain points.  We apply the
proposed method to estimate the Moho depth for the South American
continent using satellite gravity data and seismological data.  The final
Moho model is in accordance with previous gravity-derived models and
seismological data.  The misfit to the gravity and seismological data is
worse in the Andes and best in oceanic areas, central Brazil and
Patagonia, and along the Atlantic coast.  Similarly to previous results,
the model suggests a thinner crust of 30-35 km under the Andean foreland
basins.  Discrepancies with the seismological data are greatest in the
Guyana Shield, the central Solimões and Amazonas Basins, the Paraná
Basin, and the Borborema province.  These differences suggest the
existence of crustal or mantle density anomalies that were unaccounted
for during gravity data processing.
