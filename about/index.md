## Who am I?

I'm first and foremost a Dedicated Involved Loving Father.
On the rare occasions where I find myself with free time, I enjoy
playing Incineroar in [Super Smash Bros Ultimate][smash],
baking sourdough bread,
making noise with my ukulele and off-tune baritone,
listening to podcasts,
and reading sci-fi and fantasy.
My favorite show is by far [Avatar: The Last Airbender][avatar]
and I've been sucked into the [Cosmere books][cosmere] by
[Brandon Sanderson][sanderson].

I work as Lecturer in Geophysics at the University of Liverpool's
[Department of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences][deoes] in the UK,
where I started the [Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab]({{ config.links.compgeolab }}).
Before coming to Liverpool, I was a visiting research scholar at the
[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa][uh], where I worked with the
[Generic Mapping Tools]({{ config.links.gmt }}) team to create
[PyGMT]({{ config.links.pygmt }}), a widely-used Python library for processing
and visualizing geophysical data.
Prior to Hawaiʻi, I worked for three years as Assistant Professor at the
Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

My research and teaching make heavy use of open-source software and computing
in general to gain insights on the inner workings of the Earth.
I am one of the core developers and maintainer of the
[Fatiando a Terra]({{ config.links.fatiando }}) project, a community-developed set of open-source
Python libraries for the Geosciences.
