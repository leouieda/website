## Work

* Committed to **open practices** in teaching and research

### Need a photo?

If you need a photo of me for promotional material
(for talks or interviews, for example), use this one.

## Software

Here are some of the open-source source software develop:

* [**Fatiando a Terra**]({{ config.links.fatiando }}): Collection of Python
  libraries for Geophysics built by a community of geoscientists and software
  developers with a passion for well-designed tools and helping our peers. I've
  been working on Fatiando since around 2010 when I started my MSc. It's been
  the **main focus of my career** and it permeates all aspects of my work, from
  research to teaching.
* [**PyGMT**]({{ config.links.pygmt }}): The [Generic Mapping Tools]({{
  config.links.gmt }}) (GMT) is one of the most **widely used open-source
  projects in the Earth Sciences**. I had the pleasure to [join the GMT
  team](/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc.html) as a postdoc to create
  PyGMT. Lately, my contributions to GMT and PyGMT have been more on the
  community and guidance side. Thankfully, they don't really need me for the
  coding parts anymore.
* [**Tesseroids**]({{ config.links.tesseroids }}): Command-line programs for
  modelling the gravitational attraction of spherical prisms (tesseroids). This
  was my **first open-source project**, which I started during my BSc
  dissertation project with [Naomi
  Ussami](http://lattes.cnpq.br/6704246490515612) and [Carla
  Braitenberg](https://www2.units.it/braitenberg/). Through Tesseroids, I
  learned about documentation, unit tests, cross-compilation, version control,
  and more.
* [**Nēnē**]({{ config.links.nene }}): A no-frills static site generator. It's
  the side project that I use to blow off steam and experiment with new Python
  features. It's also what I **use to build this website**. The name is a nod
  to [Urubu](https://github.com/jandecaluwe/urubu), which I used to build my
  website before, and the [unforgettable time I spent in
  Hawai'i](/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc.html).

## xlandsat

Website: <a href="https://www.compgeolab.org/xlandsat" target="_blank">www.compgeolab.org/xlandsat</a>

A small Python library for loading Landsat multi-spectral remote sensing scenes
from downloaded from [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) into
``xarray.Dataset`` containers. It takes care of reading the metadata and
organizing the bands into a single data structure for easier manipulation,
processing, and visualization.

`xlandsat` started as code I wrote for my
[remote sensing class at Liverpool](../teaching) which I made into a package to
make sure students can get started manipulating data with as little overhead as
possible.
It's also what I used to make some
[pretty images of the 2022 Mauna Loa volcano eruption](../blog/mauna-loa.html).



## Personal

I was raised in [Botucatu][botucatu], a small town about 200 km from São Paulo,
Brazil.
I've lived in many places: Ithaca (USA), São Paulo (Brazil), Toronto (Canada),
Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Honolulu (Hawai'i/USA), and Liverpool (UK).

**Things I enjoy:**
  playing Incineroar in [Super Smash Bros Ultimate][smash],
  failing to finish [Tears of the Kingdom][zelda],
  baking [bread][bread],
  making noise with my ukulele and off-tune baritone,
  sci-fi and [fantasy][cosmere]
