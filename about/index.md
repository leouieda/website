## Who am I?

I'm first and foremost a Dedicated Involved Loving Father.
On the rare occasions where I find myself with free time, I enjoy
playing Incineroar in [Super Smash Bros Ultimate][smash],
baking sourdough bread,
making noise with my ukulele and off-tune baritone,
listening to podcasts,
and reading sci-fi and fantasy.
My favorite show is [Avatar: The Last Airbender][avatar]
and I've been sucked into the [Cosmere books][cosmere] by
[Brandon Sanderson][sanderson].

My research focus is in creating and applying computational tools and
techniques for imagining the Earth through measurements of gravity and magnetic
fields.
Check out the [Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab]({{ config.links.compgeolab }}),
for highlights of my research and the team behind it.
All of my work makes heavy use of open-source software.
I'm the founder of [PyGMT]({{ config.links.pygmt }}), a widely-used Python
library for processing and visualizing geophysical data, and the
[Fatiando a Terra]({{ config.links.fatiando }}) project, a community-developed
set of open-source Python libraries for the Geosciences.
