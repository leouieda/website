      We present methodological improvements to forward modeling and regional
      inversion of satellite gravity data. For this purpose, we developed two
      open-source software projects. The first is a C language suite of
      command-line programs called Tesseroids. The programs calculate the
      gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor of a spherical
      prism, or tesseroid. Tesseroids implements and extends an adaptive
      discretization algorithm to automatically ensure the accuracy of the
      computations. Our numerical experiments show that, to achieve the same
      level of accuracy, the gravitational acceleration components require
      finner discretization than the potential. In turn, the gradient tensor
      requires finner discretization still than the acceleration. The second
      open-source project is Fatiando a Terra, a Python language library for
      inversion, forward modeling, data processing, and visualization. The
      library allows the user to combine the forward modeling and inversion
      tools to implement new inversion methods. The gravity forward modeling
      tools include an implementation of the algorithm used in the Tesseroids
      software. We combined the inversion and tesseroid forward modeling
      utilities of Fatiando a Terra to develop a new method for fast non-linear
      gravity inversion. The method estimates the depth of the crust-mantle
      interface (the Moho) based on observed gravity data using a spherical
      Earth approximation. We extended the computationally efficient Bott's
      method to include smoothness regularization and use tesseroids instead
      right rectangular prisms. The inversion is controlled by three
      hyper-parameters: the regularization parameter, the density-contrast
      between the real Earth and the reference model (the Normal Earth), and
      the depth of the Moho of the Normal Earth. We employ two cross-validation
      procedures to automatically estimate these parameters. Tests on synthetic
      data confirm the capability of the proposed method to estimate smoothly
      varying Moho depths and the three hyper-parameters. Finally, we applied
      the inversion method developed to produce a Moho depth model for South
      America. The estimated Moho depth model fits the gravity data and
      seismological Moho depth estimates in the oceanic areas and the central
      and eastern portions of the continent. We observe large misfits in the
      Andes region, where Moho depth is largest. In Amazon, Solimões, and
      Paraná Basins, the model fits the observed gravity but disagrees with
      seismological estimates. These discrepancies suggest the existence of
      density-anomalies in the crust or upper mantle, as has been suggested in
      the literature.

      I did my Master's degree in Geophysics at the Observatório Nacional in
      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under the supervision of <a
      href="https://www.pinga-lab.org/people/barbosa.html">Valéria C. F.
      Barbosa</a>. I started in March 2010 and defended my dissertation in
      October 2011.
      The method that we developed is implemented in the software

      We have developed a new gravity gradient inversion method for estimating
      a 3D density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of rectangular
      prisms. Our method consists of an iterative algorithm that does not
      require the solution of an equation system. Instead, the solution grows
      systematically around user-specified prismatic elements, called "seeds",
      with given density contrasts. Each seed can be assigned a different
      density-contrast value, allowing the interpretation of multiple sources
      with different density contrasts and that produce interfering signals. In
      real world scenarios, some sources might not be targeted for the
      interpretation. Thus, we developed a robust procedure that neither
      requires the isolation of the signal of the targeted sources prior to the
      inversion nor requires substantial prior information about the
      nontargeted sources. In our iterative algorithm, the estimated sources
      grow by the accretion of prisms in the periphery of the current estimate.
      In addition, only the columns of the sensitivity matrix corresponding to
      the prisms in the periphery of the current estimate are needed for the
      computations. Therefore, the individual columns of the sensitivity matrix
      can be calculated on demand and deleted after an accretion takes place,
      greatly reducing the demand for computer memory and processing time.
      Tests on synthetic data show the ability of our method to correctly
      recover the geometry of the targeted sources, even when interfering
      signals produced by nontargeted sources are present. Inverting the data
      from an airborne gravity gradiometry survey flown over the iron ore
      province of Quadrilátero Ferrífero, southeastern Brazil, we estimated a
      compact iron ore body that is in agreement with geologic information and
      previous interpretations.

      My Bachelor's degree in Geophysics is from the Universidade de São Paulo,
      Brazil, where I studied from 2004 until 2009. I did an undergraduate
      research project and eventually my thesis under the supervision of
      <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/6704246490515612">Naomi Ussami</a>.
      This was when I started development of the software
      <a href="https://github.com/leouieda/tesseroids">Tesseroids</a> and the
      research that lead to the paper which is the first part of my PhD thesis:

    abstract: |
      The GOCE satellite mission has the objective of measuring the Earths
      gravitational field with an unprecedented accuracy through the
      measurement of the gravity gradient tensor (GGT). The data provided by
      this mission could be used to study large areas, where the flat Earth
      approximation can have its limitations. In these cases the modeling could
      be done with tesseroids, also called spherical prisms, in order to take
      the Earths curvature into account. The GGT caused by a tesseroid can be
      calculated with numerical integration methods, such as the Gauss-Legendre
      Quadrature (GLQ). In the current project, a computer program was
      developed for the direct calculation of the GGT using the GLQ. The
      accuracy of this implementation was evaluated by comparing its results
      with the result of analytical formulas for the special case of a
      spherical cap. Next, the developed program was used to calculate the
      differences in the GGT caused by the flat Earth approximation. These
      differences reach are up to 30% in the Tzz component for a 50 deg x 50
      deg x 10 km model. Finally, the computer program was used to calculate
      the effect caused by the topographic masses on the GGT at 250 km altitude
      for the Paraná basin region. In regions of large topographical
      variations, the components of the GGT due to the topographic masses have
      amplitudes of the same order of magnitude as the GGT components due to
      density anomalies in the interior of the crust and mantle.
