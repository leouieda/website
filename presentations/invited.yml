    <p>
    This is an invited presentation about the past, current, and future of
    the Fatiando a Terra project. We will cover the current functionality,
    recent developments, and lessons learned along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
    The presentation is centered around a tutorial that walks you through the
    steps of transforming observed absolute gravity measurements into a grid
    of residual gravity disturbances at a constant height. The tutorial
    showcases some of the core utilities of all of our open-source libraries.

    The Fatiando a Terra project (https://www.fatiando.org) was started in
    2010 as a Python library for visualization, forward modelling, and
    inversion across different geophysical methods. Over the following 8
    years, the project attracted new contributors and grew to include
    cutting-edge methods, toy examples for teaching, and helper functions for
    visualization. Standards around testing, documentation, and code style
    evolved and new tools appeared around the ecosystem (such as SimPEG,
    PyVista, Devito, and pyGIMLi), making some of our functionality redundant
    and outdated. In an attempt to better interface with the emerging
    ecosystem, we started a major restructuring of the code base in 2018.
    This presentation will cover the current available functionality and some
    of the lessons learned from developing, growing, and maintaining the
    project, including current challenges and our future plans.

    This is an invited talk for the first part of an "Open Scince in Action"
    session, with 10 minute talks by panelists followed by a panel
    discussion.

    In this presentation, we will demonstrate the workflow that we have been
    establishing at the Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab for building
    "repro-packs" for our papers and projects. We use a combination of
    virtual environments, data download and caching tools, notebooks,
    Makefiles, and data repositories to provide others with the means to
    reproduce and build upon our work. We will also share some of the
    unsolved challenges that we have encountered and our dreams for an ideal
    workflow.

    <p>
    I had the pleasure of giving this talk to the SEG and EAGE Student
    Chapter of the Observatório Nacional (where I went to grad school). It
    was about my path through science and some tips for those wanting to go
    abroad. Slides and talk were in Portuguese.

    This talk is about our recent on the Boule and Harmonica libraries and
    how they fit into our current and future research plans. It includes a
    live demo of using these tools to process real ground gravity data.

    <p>
    It was an invited talk to the geophysical modelling group at GFZ. Thank
    you to Angela Maria Gomez Garcia for the invitation.

    The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python
    libraries for geophysics which cover a range of functionalities, from
    data download and processing to modeling and inversion. Many of our tools
    are general purpose but we also focus on gravimetry and magnetometry.
    Development on the projected started in 2010 and has gone through several
    iterations as the team matured and established best practices for
    maintaining software projects in the open.
    This talk is an overview of the history and current iteration of the
    project, including a short demonstration of our current capabilities for
    downloading and processing gravity data. We will then move on to our
    plans for future directions of the projects and information of how you
    can get involved. Finally, we will briefly discuss some of the challenges
    and opportunities of adopting open-science practices.
