    This talk is about our recent on the Boule and Harmonica libraries and
    how they fit into our current and future research plans. It includes a
    live demo of using these tools to process real ground gravity data.
    It was an invited talk to the geophysical modelling group at GFZ. Thank
    you to Angela Maria Gomez Garcia for the invitation.

    The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python
    libraries for geophysics which cover a range of functionalities, from
    data download and processing to modeling and inversion. Many of our tools
    are general purpose but we also focus on gravimetry and magnetometry.
    Development on the projected started in 2010 and has gone through several
    iterations as the team matured and established best practices for
    maintaining software projects in the open.
    This talk is an overview of the history and current iteration of the
    project, including a short demonstration of our current capabilities for
    downloading and processing gravity data. We will then move on to our
    plans for future directions of the projects and information of how you
    can get involved. Finally, we will briefly discuss some of the challenges
    and opportunities of adopting open-science practices.

    The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python
    libraries for geophysics which cover a range of functionalities, from
    data download and processing to modeling and inversion. In this
    opportunity we will present the two libraries that are focused on
    potential fields: Harmonica and Boule. Boule implements reference
    ellipsoids (including oblate ellipsoids, spheres, and soon triaxial
    ellipsoids), conversions between ellipsoidal and geocentric spherical
    coordinates, and normal gravity calculations. The latter are performed
    using analytical expressions for gravity fields at any point outside of
    the ellipsoid. Harmonica provides tools for processing, forward
    modelling, and inversion of gravity and magnetic data. We will
    demonstrate its use to compute Bouguer gravity disturbances by forward
    modelling the topography with prisms, removing a 2nd order regional
    trend, and interpolating it onto a regular grid at a constant height
    using the equivalent layer technique. Both libraries are still evolving
    as we continue to refine their goals and scopes. We invite everyone to
    get involved in the development, whether it's through coding, writing
    documentation, or giving feedback.

    I've given this talk at a few places in 2020 with some modifications to the
    slides. This is a presentation about my path through geophysics and
    open-source software, how it's shaped my research and teaching, what I see
    as the future of this area (with some tips for informing yourself on
    current software best practices), and some of the research we're doing at
    the Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab.

    This was another online version of the talk. It was really nice to
    connect with the geophysicists at Kiel since Prof. Jörg Ebbing's group
    uses Tesseroids and was involved in the generation of the GOCE gravity
    gradient grids cited in the talk. They have also used the Moho inversion
    code and are getting involved in Fatiando. I added some bits to the end
    about getting involved in open-source software projects and finding
    online communities of practice (with a shout out to the Software
    Underground).

    I was really delighted to get an invitation to speak at my alma mater
    (roughly 10 years after my graduation). The talk was also delivered
    online. This was the first time delivering this talk in Portuguese, which
    was a struggle since I had the words prepared in English already (slides
    are still in English, though). I added the latest news of the successful
    reproduction of the Ferguson COVID-19 modelling results. Funny enough,
    this talk is heavily inspired on the last talk I gave there in 2015.

    This is the second version of this talk and it was delivered online
    because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I changed it a bit to reflect current
    research presented at EGU2020 and focus less on the technical side of
    development. The online delivery was new to me but it worked out well.
    Even though it can be strange to talk to a screen for 50 minutes, the
    great questions afterwards more than made up for it.

    I gave this talk at the Earth Sciences Research Group (ESRG) seminar
    series of the University of Liverpool. This was my first talk to the
    department and I decided to layout why I think open-source development
    boosts research productivity and what are the tools we use every day. I
    hope to help people find these tools and lead by example in the
    <a href="https://www.compgeolab.org">Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab</a>.
  abstract: |
    In this talk, I'll go over some of my work on open-source geophysics
    software (Python and GMT), how we're building communities around them,
    and how this ties into my current research and efforts towards
    reproducibility.

    Sciences</a>, University of Hawaii at Manoa.
    The topic merges my interest in machine learning, how we can borrow some
    techniques for geophysical inversion, and the similarities with gridding
    problems, like my work on GPS gridding.
  abstract: |
    Machine learning is the new trend sweeping across the Earth Sciences.
    From the oil and gas industry to oceanography, these algorithms are being
    trained to solve previously unsolvable (or extremely tedious) problems.
    But what exactly is "machine learning" and what can be done with it? In
    this talk, I will present a brief high-level overview of some of the core
    concepts and interesting applications of machine learning methods to
    geoscience data. I will also explore some of the best practices and
    techniques that can be applied to geophysical inversion and interpolation
    methods, including a new method for gridding 3-component GPS data.

    for my <a href="/blog/hawaii-gmt-postdoc.html">postdoc to work on GMT</a>.
    The last interesting results that I'd had were from my PhD thesis so I
    thought I'd present that, though heavily edited in the interest of time.

    The inner density distribution of the Earth can be inferred from
    disturbances in its gravitational field. However, accomplishing this is
    never easy. There are many possible parameterizations for the
    mathematical model, which is often non-linear. To make matters worse,
    gravity data alone do not contain enough information to obtain a unique
    and stable solution. One must add independent information to constrain
    the solution space, often in the form of regularization. Many different
    methods for performing this inference have been developed and research in
    this field is still active. Investigating new methodologies implies
    developing complex software, which often must be able to deal with sparse
    matrices and parallelism. I’ll present the open-source Python library
    Fatiando a Terra. It implements many of the components required for
    developing inversion methods, such as forward modeling, data processing
    and I/O, and regularization. I’ll also show how I used this library to
    develop a computationally efficient method for estimating the Moho depth
    from gravity data using a spherical approximation of the Earth.

    This is a presentation I gave for the Department of Geophysics of the
    University of São Paulo and also at the Observatório Nacional. It's about
    my open-source project Fatiando a Terra and how I'm using for teaching
    geophysics and doing my own research on inverse problems. It was also my
    first invited talk and it was an honor to be back at my alma mater as a
    professor instead of a student.
  abstract: |
    O Fatiando a Terra é uma biblioteca feita na linguagem Python que tem
    como objetivo facilitar o trabalho de pesquisadores e professores na área
    geofísica. Os módulos da biblioteca foram planejados para facilitar a
    combinação de seus componentes de diversas formas. Por exemplo, o mesmo
    módulo de modelagem direta pode ser usado para produzir dados sintéticos,
    desenvolver um método de inversão ou como parte de uma interface gráfica
    interativa. Além disso, as funções da biblioteca podem ser combinadas com
    funções desenvolvidas pelo usuário e com as muitas bibliotecas
    científicas da linguagem Python. O módulo de problemas inversos
    automatiza grande parte da implementação de um novo método de inversão. O
    pesquisador implementa somente o cálculo de dados preditos e da matriz de
    sensibilidade, ambos reutilizando os diversos módulos de modelagem
    direta. Com essas duas funções, o usuário pode escolher livremente entre
    diversos métodos de optimização e regularização para executar sua
    inversão.
    Para o ensino de geofísica, a biblioteca pode ser combinada com a
    interatividade de outros programas, particularmente o IPython notebook
    (www.ipython.org). Conceitos difíceis de serem transmitidos em aula podem
    ser explorados pelos alunos de forma interativa, com botões, gráficos e
    animações. Por exemplo, para ensinar a reflexão e refração de ondas
    sísmicas, o professor pode utilizar simulações numéricas da propagação de
    ondas para produzir animações em tempo real. Outro exemplo é permitir aos
    alunos explorar como o campo geomagnético interage com um corpo geológico
    a diferentes latitudes para produzir uma anomalia magnética de campo
    total. Dessa forma, os alunos ganham experiência e intuição ao interagir
    com os resultados.
    A implementação de diversos métodos geofísicos em uma única biblioteca
    fornece a base necessária para a rápida criação de novas metodologias e
    material didático interativo. A maior parte da funcionalidade atual é
    para gravimetria e magnetometria, embora já exista um núcleo de sísmica e
    sismologia que está sendo desenvolvido. O projeto necessita de usuários e
    desenvolvedores para crescer e abranger os demais ramos da geofísica. O
    projeto é software livre e contribuições de qualquer forma são bem
    vindas.
