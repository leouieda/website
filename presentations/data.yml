      I had the pleasure of giving this talk to the SEG and EAGE Student
      Chapter of the Observatório Nacional (where I went to grad school). It
      was about my path through science and some tips for those wanting to go
      abroad. Slides and talk were in Portuguese.

      This talk is about our recent on the Boule and Harmonica libraries and
      how they fit into our current and future research plans. It includes a
      live demo of using these tools to process real ground gravity data.
      </p>
      <p>
      It was an invited talk to the geophysical modelling group at GFZ. Thank
      you to Angela Maria Gomez Garcia for the invitation.

      The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python
      libraries for geophysics which cover a range of functionalities, from
      data download and processing to modeling and inversion. Many of our tools
      are general purpose but we also focus on gravimetry and magnetometry.
      Development on the projected started in 2010 and has gone through several
      iterations as the team matured and established best practices for
      maintaining software projects in the open.
      This talk is an overview of the history and current iteration of the
      project, including a short demonstration of our current capabilities for
      downloading and processing gravity data. We will then move on to our
      plans for future directions of the projects and information of how you
      can get involved. Finally, we will briefly discuss some of the challenges
      and opportunities of adopting open-science practices.

      This was an invited talk to the Potential Fields group of the GSH. Thank

      The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python
      libraries for geophysics which cover a range of functionalities, from
      data download and processing to modeling and inversion. In this
      opportunity we will present the two libraries that are focused on
      potential fields: Harmonica and Boule. Boule implements reference
      ellipsoids (including oblate ellipsoids, spheres, and soon triaxial
      ellipsoids), conversions between ellipsoidal and geocentric spherical
      coordinates, and normal gravity calculations. The latter are performed
      using analytical expressions for gravity fields at any point outside of
      the ellipsoid. Harmonica provides tools for processing, forward
      modelling, and inversion of gravity and magnetic data. We will
      demonstrate its use to compute Bouguer gravity disturbances by forward
      modelling the topography with prisms, removing a 2nd order regional
      trend, and interpolating it onto a regular grid at a constant height
      using the equivalent layer technique. Both libraries are still evolving
      as we continue to refine their goals and scopes. We invite everyone to
      get involved in the development, whether it's through coding, writing
      documentation, or giving feedback.

      <p>
      Gravimetry is a routine part of the geophysicists toolset, historically
      used in geophysics following the geodetic definitions of gravity
      anomalies and their related “reductions”. Several authors have shown that
      the geodetic concept of a gravity anomaly does not align with goals of
      gravimetry in geophysics (the investigation of anomalous density
      distributions). Much of this confusion likely stems from the lack of
      widely available tools for performing the corrections needed to arrive at
      a geophysically meaningful gravity disturbance. For example, free-air
      corrections are completely unnecessary since analytical expressions for
      theoretical gravity at any point have existed for over a decade. Since
      this is not easily done in a spreadsheet or short script, modern tools
      for processing and modelling gravity data for geophysics are needed.
      These tools must be trustworthy (i.e., extensively tested) and designed
      with software development and geophysical best practices in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
      We present the Python libraries Harmonica and Boule, which are part of
      the <a href="https://www.fatiando.org">Fatiando a Terra</a> project. Both
      tools are open-source under the permissive BSD license and are developed
      in the open by a community of geoscientists and programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
      Harmonica provides tools for processing, forward modelling, and inversion
      of gravity and magnetic data. The first release of Harmonica was focused
      on implementing methods for processing and interpolation with the
      equivalent source technique, as well as forward modelling with
      right-rectangular prisms, point sources, and tesseroids. Current work is
      directed towards implementing a processing pipeline for gravity data,
      including topographic corrections in Cartesian and spherical coordinates,
      atmospheric corrections, and more. The software is still in early stages
      of development and design and would benefit greatly from community
      involvement and feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
      Boule implements reference ellipsoids (including oblate ellipsoids,
      spheres, and soon triaxial ellipsoids), conversions between ellipsoidal
      and geocentric spherical coordinates, and normal gravity calculations
      using analytical solutions for gravity fields at any point outside of the
      ellipsoid. It includes ellipsoids for the Earth as well as other
      planetary bodies in the solar system, like Mars, the Moon, Venus, and
      Mercury. This enables the calculation of gravity disturbances for Earth
      and planetary data without the need for free-air corrections. Boule was
      created out of the shared needs of Harmonica,
      <a href="https://github.com/SHTOOLS">SHTools</a>,
      and <a href="https://github.com/ioshchepkov/pygeoid">pygeoid</a> and is
      developed with input from developers of these projects.
      </p>
      <p>
      We welcome participation from the wider geophysical community,
      irrespective of programming skill level and experience, and are actively
      searching for interested developers and users to get involved in shaping
      the future of these projects.

      This is a talk about my path through geophysics and open-source software,
      how it's shaped my research and teaching, what I see as the future of
      this area (with some tips for informing yourself on current software best
      practices), and some of the research we're doing at the Computer-Oriented
      Geoscience Lab.

      I've given this talk at a few places in 2020 with some slight
      modifications to the slides.

      This is the first version of this talk, delivered at the GDSL group
      seminars. It was about my path through geophysics guided by my interests
      in making open-source software: how I got started with coding, the various
      projects I'm developing, how that's shaped my research, and plans for the
      future.

      This is the second version of this talk and it was delivered online
      because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I changed it a bit to reflect current
      research presented at EGU2020 and focus less on the technical side of
      development. The online delivery was new to me but it worked out well.
      Even though it can be strange to talk to a screen for 50 minutes, the
      great questions afterwards more than made up for it.

      I was really delighted to get an invitation to speak at my alma mater
      (roughly 10 years after my graduation). The talk was also delivered
      online. This was the first time delivering this talk in Portuguese, which
      was a struggle since I had the words prepared in English already (slides
      are still in English, though). I added the latest news of the successful
      reproduction of the Ferguson COVID-19 modelling results. Funny enough,
      this talk is heavily inspired on the last talk I gave there in 2015.

      This was another online version of the talk. It was really nice to
      connect with the geophysicists at Kiel since Prof. Jörg Ebbing's group
      uses Tesseroids and was involved in the generation of the GOCE gravity
      gradient grids cited in the talk. They have also used the Moho inversion
      code and are getting involved in Fatiando. I added some bits to the end
      about getting involved in open-source software projects and finding
      online communities of practice (with a shout out to the Software
      Underground).
