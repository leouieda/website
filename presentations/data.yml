    abstract: |
      This is a talk about my path through geophysics and open-source software,
      how it's shaped my research and teaching, what I see as the future of
      this area (with some tips for informing yourself on current software best
      practices), and some of the research we're doing at the Computer-Oriented
      Geoscience Lab.

      I've given this talk at a few places in 2020 with some slight
      modifications to the slides.

      This is the first version of this talk, delivered at the GDSL group
      seminars. It was about my path through geophysics guided by my interests
      in making open-source software: how I got started with coding, the various
      projects I'm developing, how that's shaped my research, and plans for the
      future.

      This is the second version of this talk and it was delivered online
      because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I changed it a bit to reflect current
      research presented at EGU2020 and focus less on the technical side of
      development. The online delivery was new to me but it worked out well.
      Even though it can be strange to talk to a screen for 50 minutes, the
      great questions afterwards more than made up for it.

      I was really delighted to get an invitation to speak at my alma mater
      (roughly 10 years after my graduation). The talk was also delivered
      online. This was the first time delivering this talk in Portuguese, which
      was a struggle since I had the words prepared in English already (slides
      are still in English, though). I added the latest news of the successful
      reproduction of the Ferguson COVID-19 modelling results. Funny enough,
      this talk is heavily inspired on the last talk I gave there in 2015.

      This was another online version of the talk. It was really nice to
      connect with the geophysicists at Kiel since Prof. Jörg Ebbing's group
      uses Tesseroids and was involved in the generation of the GOCE gravity
      gradient grids cited in the talk. They have also used the Moho inversion
      code and are getting involved in Fatiando. I added some bits to the end
      about getting involved in open-source software projects and finding
      online communities of practice (with a shout out to the Software
      Underground).
