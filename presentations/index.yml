      <p>
      This is an invited presentation about the past, current, and future of
      the Fatiando a Terra project. We will cover the current functionality,
      recent developments, and lessons learned along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
      The presentation is centered around a tutorial that walks you through the
      steps of transforming observed absolute gravity measurements into a grid
      of residual gravity disturbances at a constant height. The tutorial
      showcases some of the core utilities of all of our open-source libraries.
      </p>

      The Fatiando a Terra project (https://www.fatiando.org) was started in
      2010 as a Python library for visualization, forward modelling, and
      inversion across different geophysical methods. Over the following 8
      years, the project attracted new contributors and grew to include
      cutting-edge methods, toy examples for teaching, and helper functions for
      visualization. Standards around testing, documentation, and code style
      evolved and new tools appeared around the ecosystem (such as SimPEG,
      PyVista, Devito, and pyGIMLi), making some of our functionality redundant
      and outdated. In an attempt to better interface with the emerging
      ecosystem, we started a major restructuring of the code base in 2018.
      This presentation will cover the current available functionality and some
      of the lessons learned from developing, growing, and maintaining the
      project, including current challenges and our future plans.

      In this presentation, we will demonstrate the workflow that we have been
      establishing at the Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab for building
      "repro-packs" for our papers and projects. We use a combination of
      virtual environments, data download and caching tools, notebooks,
      Makefiles, and data repositories to provide others with the means to
      reproduce and build upon our work. We will also share some of the
      unsolved challenges that we have encountered and our dreams for an ideal
      workflow.

      The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python
      libraries for geophysics which cover a range of functionalities, from
      data download and processing to modeling and inversion. Many of our tools
      are general purpose but we also focus on gravimetry and magnetometry.
      Development on the projected started in 2010 and has gone through several
      iterations as the team matured and established best practices for
      maintaining software projects in the open.
      This talk is an overview of the history and current iteration of the
      project, including a short demonstration of our current capabilities for
      downloading and processing gravity data. We will then move on to our
      plans for future directions of the projects and information of how you
      can get involved. Finally, we will briefly discuss some of the challenges
      and opportunities of adopting open-science practices.

      The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python
      libraries for geophysics which cover a range of functionalities, from
      data download and processing to modeling and inversion. In this
      opportunity we will present the two libraries that are focused on
      potential fields: Harmonica and Boule. Boule implements reference
      ellipsoids (including oblate ellipsoids, spheres, and soon triaxial
      ellipsoids), conversions between ellipsoidal and geocentric spherical
      coordinates, and normal gravity calculations. The latter are performed
      using analytical expressions for gravity fields at any point outside of
      the ellipsoid. Harmonica provides tools for processing, forward
      modelling, and inversion of gravity and magnetic data. We will
      demonstrate its use to compute Bouguer gravity disturbances by forward
      modelling the topography with prisms, removing a 2nd order regional
      trend, and interpolating it onto a regular grid at a constant height
      using the equivalent layer technique. Both libraries are still evolving
      as we continue to refine their goals and scopes. We invite everyone to
      get involved in the development, whether it's through coding, writing
      documentation, or giving feedback.

      <p>
      Gravimetry is a routine part of the geophysicists toolset, historically
      used in geophysics following the geodetic definitions of gravity
      anomalies and their related “reductions”. Several authors have shown that
      the geodetic concept of a gravity anomaly does not align with goals of
      gravimetry in geophysics (the investigation of anomalous density
      distributions). Much of this confusion likely stems from the lack of
      widely available tools for performing the corrections needed to arrive at
      a geophysically meaningful gravity disturbance. For example, free-air
      corrections are completely unnecessary since analytical expressions for
      theoretical gravity at any point have existed for over a decade. Since
      this is not easily done in a spreadsheet or short script, modern tools
      for processing and modelling gravity data for geophysics are needed.
      These tools must be trustworthy (i.e., extensively tested) and designed
      with software development and geophysical best practices in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
      We present the Python libraries Harmonica and Boule, which are part of
      the <a href="https://www.fatiando.org">Fatiando a Terra</a> project. Both
      tools are open-source under the permissive BSD license and are developed
      in the open by a community of geoscientists and programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
      Harmonica provides tools for processing, forward modelling, and inversion
      of gravity and magnetic data. The first release of Harmonica was focused
      on implementing methods for processing and interpolation with the
      equivalent source technique, as well as forward modelling with
      right-rectangular prisms, point sources, and tesseroids. Current work is
      directed towards implementing a processing pipeline for gravity data,
      including topographic corrections in Cartesian and spherical coordinates,
      atmospheric corrections, and more. The software is still in early stages
      of development and design and would benefit greatly from community
      involvement and feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
      Boule implements reference ellipsoids (including oblate ellipsoids,
      spheres, and soon triaxial ellipsoids), conversions between ellipsoidal
      and geocentric spherical coordinates, and normal gravity calculations
      using analytical solutions for gravity fields at any point outside of the
      ellipsoid. It includes ellipsoids for the Earth as well as other
      planetary bodies in the solar system, like Mars, the Moon, Venus, and
      Mercury. This enables the calculation of gravity disturbances for Earth
      and planetary data without the need for free-air corrections. Boule was
      created out of the shared needs of Harmonica,
      <a href="https://github.com/SHTOOLS">SHTools</a>,
      and <a href="https://github.com/ioshchepkov/pygeoid">pygeoid</a> and is
      developed with input from developers of these projects.
      </p>
      <p>
      We welcome participation from the wider geophysical community,
      irrespective of programming skill level and experience, and are actively
      searching for interested developers and users to get involved in shaping
      the future of these projects.

      This is the first version of this talk, delivered at the GDSL group
      seminars. It was about my path through geophysics guided by my interests
      in making open-source software: how I got started with coding, the various
      projects I'm developing, how that's shaped my research, and plans for the
      future.

      This is the second version of this talk and it was delivered online
      because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I changed it a bit to reflect current
      research presented at EGU2020 and focus less on the technical side of
      development. The online delivery was new to me but it worked out well.
      Even though it can be strange to talk to a screen for 50 minutes, the
      great questions afterwards more than made up for it.

      I was really delighted to get an invitation to speak at my alma mater

      online. This was the first time delivering this talk in Portuguese, which
      was a struggle since I had the words prepared in English already (slides
      are still in English, though). I added the latest news of the successful
      reproduction of the Ferguson COVID-19 modelling results. Funny enough,
      this talk is heavily inspired on the last talk I gave there in 2015.

      This was another online version of the talk. It was really nice to
      connect with the geophysicists at Kiel since Prof. Jörg Ebbing's group
      uses Tesseroids and was involved in the generation of the GOCE gravity
      gradient grids cited in the talk. They have also used the Moho inversion
      code and are getting involved in Fatiando. I added some bits to the end
      about getting involved in open-source software projects and finding
      online communities of practice (with a shout out to the Software
      Underground).

    abstract: |
      <p>
      We investigate the use of cross-validation (CV) techniques to estimate
      the accuracy of equivalent-source (also known as equivalent-layer) models
      for interpolation and processing of potential-field data. Our preliminary
      results indicate that some common CV algorithms (e.g., random
      permutations and k-folds) tend to overestimate the accuracy. We have
      found that blocked CV methods, where the data are split along spatial
      blocks instead of randomly, provide more conservative and realistic
      accuracy estimates. Beyond evaluating an equivalent-source model's
      performance, cross-validation can be used to automatically determine
      configuration parameters, like source depth and amount of regularization,
      that maximize prediction accuracy and avoid over-fitting.
      </p>
      <p>
      Widely used in gravity and magnetic data processing, the
      equivalent-source technique consists of a linear model (usually point
      sources) used to predict the observed field at arbitrary locations.
      Upward-continuation, interpolation, gradient calculations, leveling, and
      reduction-to-the-pole can be performed simultaneously by using the model
      to make predictions (i.e., forward modelling). Likewise, the use of
      linear models to make predictions is the backbone of many machine
      learning (ML) applications. The predictive performance of ML models is
      usually evaluated through cross-validation, in which the data are split
      (usually randomly) into a training set and a validation set. Models are
      fit on the training set and their predictions are evaluated using the
      validation set using a goodness-of-fit metric, like the mean square error
      or the R² coefficient of determination. Many cross-validation methods
      exist in the literature, varying in how the data are split and how this
      process is repeated. Prior research from the statistical modelling of
      ecological data suggests that prediction accuracy is usually
      overestimated by traditional CV methods when the data are spatially
      auto-correlated. This issue can be mitigated by splitting the data along
      spatial blocks rather than randomly. We conducted experiments on
      synthetic gravity data to investigate the use of traditional and blocked
      CV methods in equivalent-source interpolation. We found that the
      overestimation problem also occurs and that more conservative accuracy
      estimates are obtained when applying blocked versions of random
      permutations and k-fold. Further studies need to be conducted to
      generalize these findings to upward-continuation, reduction-to-the-pole,
      and derivative calculation.
      </p>
      <p>
      Open-source software implementations of the equivalent-source and blocked
      cross-validation (in progress) methods are available in the Python
      libraries Harmonica and Verde, which are part of the Fatiando a Terra
      project.

    abstract: |
      For almost 30 years, the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) have provided the
      Earth, Ocean, and Planetary Sciences with an open-source toolbox for
      processing and visualizing spatial data (bathymetry, gravity, magnetic,
      earthquake focal mechanisms, and more). In many fields, GMT is the de
      facto standard for creating high-resolution publication quality maps,
      figures, and animations. Since version 5, GMT has provided a C language
      Application Programming Interface (API) that allows other programs to
      access its core functionality. We are using this bridge to develop
      <a href="https://www.pygmt.org">PyGMT</a>
      (formerly GMT/Python), an open-source library that allows
      users of the Python programming language to leverage the almost thirty
      years of continuous GMT development. PyGMT is designed to integrate with
      the existing scientific Python ecosystem, including popular packages such
      as numpy, pandas, and xarray. PyGMT integrates seamlessly with the
      Jupyter notebook, allowing high-quality figures to be generated
      interactively both in a personal computer and in cloud computing
      environments compatible with Jupyter. We will present the design and
      usage of the software package, latest developments and updates, and
      lessons learned during its implementation.

      This is an update on the progress we've made in <a href="https://www.pygmt.org">PyGMT</a>.
      There are examples of some of the new features implemented by myself and
      contributors, as well as the main problems we're facing and a call for
      volunteers.
      </p>
      <p>
      The main feedback we got during the meeting is that the API is not very
      intuitive for people unfamiliar with GMT (which I expect to be the
      majority of users). This has got me thinking of ways to move away from
      the direct mapping of GMT modules to PyGMT functions. Instead, we should
      implement something that makes sense in Python and call whatever GMT
      modules we need to get that done under the hood.

      GPS/GNSS measurements of deformation have high accuracy and temporal
      resolution but are spatially sparse. Conversely, InSAR provides great
      spatial resolution but is limited by the satellite look angle,
      atmospheric noise, and the delay between repeat passes. The sparse GPS
      data often need to be interpolated on regular grids to be used as
      constraints during InSAR processing or to calculate strain rates. The
      interpolation is routinely done separately for each component of the
      velocity field using minimum curvature or specialized geostatistical
      algorithms. Recently, a joint interpolation of the horizontal components
      has been proposed. It estimates forces on a thin elastic sheet that fit
      the observed data and subsequently uses the estimated model to predict
      data on regular grids or arbitrary points. The Green’s functions for the
      physical model serve as a coupling between the two vector components
      through elasticity theory. We propose an extension of this method to 3D,
      using the elastic Green’s functions to couple the horizontal and vertical
      components. This enables the inclusion of vector data projected in
      arbitrary directions, such as InSAR line-of-sight velocities. The degree
      of coupling can be controlled through the Poisson’s ratio of the medium.
      We apply damping regularization to smooth the model and avoid
      instabilities in the inverse problem. Furthermore, we automatically
      select optimal values for the Poisson’s ratio and regularization
      parameter through cross-validation, which is common in machine learning
      applications. We compare the performance of the coupled model with
      uncoupled alternatives to grid 2- and 3-component GPS velocities and
      calculate derivatives through finite-differences approximations. We will
      present preliminary results from applications to GPS data from the
      Himalayas and the calibration of InSAR data products. A future goal is to
      integrate InSAR line-of-sight velocities in a joint interpolation with
      GPS velocities.

      Vertical ground motion at fault systems can be difficult to detect due to
      their small amplitude and contamination from non-tectonic sources, such
      as ground water loading. However, it may play an important role in our
      understanding of the earthquake cycle and the associated seismic hazards.
      Ground motion measurements from GPS are often sparse and must be
      interpolated onto a regular grid (e.g., for computing strain rate),
      ideally taking into account the varying degrees of uncertainty of the
      data. Traditionally, each vector component is interpolated separately
      using minimum curvature or biharmonic spline methods. Recently, a joint
      interpolation of the two horizontal components has been developed using
      the Green's functions for a point force deforming a thin elastic sheet.
      The elasticity constraints provide a coupling between the two vector
      components and lead to improved results because the underlying physics of
      the method approximately matches that of the GPS observations. We propose
      an expansion of this method into 3D in order to incorporate vertical GPS
      velocity measurements. To smooth the model and avoid singularities, we
      formulate the interpolation as a weighted least-squares inverse problem
      with damping regularization. Optimal values of the regularization
      parameter and the Poisson's ratio of the elastic medium are determined
      through K-fold cross-validation, a technique often used in machine
      learning for model selection. Additionally, the cross-validation provides
      a measure of the accuracy of model predictions and eliminates the need
      for manual configuration. The computational load of the inversion is
      lessened by imposing a cutoff distance to the Green's functions
      computations, which makes the sensitivity matrix sparse. We will present
      preliminary results from an application to EarthScope GPS data from the
      San Andreas Fault system. In the future, we aim to develop a joint
      inversion of 3D GPS and InSAR line-of-sight velocities to improve data
      coverage.

      interpolating 2D vector data</a>.
      We're expanding it into 3D and ironing out some kinks in the methodology.
      I picked it up at the beginning of the year and have been slowly trying
      things out. It was a great chance to play with some tools from machine
      learning since this is a supervised prediction problem. Unlike most
      geophysical inversion, we're not really interested in the estimated
      parameters themselves. They are only a means to predict new values (on a
      regular grid in the case of gridding). I started implementing the tools I
      would need in a Python library called
      <a href="https://github.com/fatiando/verde">Verde</a>, which served as

      The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) are used throughout the geosciences to
      processes spatial data and create publication quality data
      visualizations, such as contour maps, earthquake focal mechanism
      solutions, and animations. The software is programmed in the C language
      and is accessed through a command-line interface. Recent versions of GMT
      also provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows
      access to the core functionality from other programming languages,
      potentially expanding the reach of GMT far beyond the current user base.
      A GMT toolbox for Matlab using the API has already been released, and an
      experimental interface from the Julia language is being developed. We are
      building a software library to interface GMT with the Python programming
      language. Popularity of Python has grown steadily in the Earth Sciences
      due to its simplicity and powerful set of scientific libraries. However,
      there is still great need for the geospatial processing and mapping
      capabilities of GMT. The GMT/Python library integrates with the
      scientific Python ecosystem through the support of common Python data
      types: numpy "ndarrays" and Pandas "DataFrames" for tabular data and
      xarray "Datasets" for grids. We have also implemented support for the
      Jupyter notebooks, a web-based interactive computing environment. These
      features will help make GMT more accessible to students and professional
      geoscientists who lack an extensive background in Unix tools and shell
      scripting. GMT/Python is an open-source project in early stages of
      development. The current focus is on the implementation of a robust set
      of core routines that implement the bridge between Python and GMT. Later,
      we will expand the library to cover the entire functionality of GMT. A
      first release is predicted for the late 2018. The latest documentation
      and source code can be accessed through the website

      few lines of code are required to make the figure in the poster. The more

      Figures generated by The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) are present in
      countless publications across the Earth sciences. The command-line
      interface of GMT lends the tool its flexibility but also creates a
      barrier to entry for beginners. Meanwhile, adoption of the Python
      programming language has grown across the scientific community. This
      growth is largely due to the simplicity and low barrier to entry of the
      language and its ecosystem of tools. Thus, it is not surprising that
      there have been at least three attempts to create Python interfaces for
      GMT: gmtpy, pygmt, and PyGMT. None of these projects are currently active
      and, with the exception of pygmt, they do not use the GMT Application
      Programming Interface (API) introduced in GMT 5.  The two main Python
      libraries for plotting data on maps are the matplotlib Basemap toolkit
      (matplotlib.org/basemap) and Cartopy (scitools.org.uk/cartopy), both of
      which rely on matplotlib (matplotlib.org) as the backend for generating
      the figures. Basemap is known to have limitations and is being
      discontinued.  Cartopy is an improvement over Basemap but is still bound
      by the speed and memory constraints of matplotlib. We present a new
      Python interface for GMT (GMT/Python) that makes use of the GMT API and
      of new features being developed for the upcoming GMT 6 release. The
      GMT/Python library is designed according to the norms and styles of the
      Python community. The library integrates with the scientific Python
      ecosystem by using the “virtual files” from the GMT API to implement
      input and output of Python data types (numpy “ndarray” for tabular data
      and xarray “Dataset” for grids). Other features include an
      object-oriented interface for creating figures, the ability to display
      figures in the Jupyter notebook, and descriptive aliases for GMT
      arguments (e.g., “region” instead of “R” and “projection” instead of
      “J”). GMT/Python can also serve as a backend for developing new
      high-level interfaces, which can help make GMT more accessible to
      beginners and more intuitive for Python users. GMT/Python is an
      open-source project hosted on GitHub and is in early stages of
      development. A first release will accompany the release of  GMT 6, which
      is expected for early 2018.

      enjoyed designing this one. The background image was generated using
      GMT/Python (see the code in the poster). It's a clean design and I like

      Scientific results are increasingly the product of software. The
      reproducibility and validity of published results cannot be ensured
      without access to the source code of the software used to produce them.
      Therefore, the code itself is a fundamental part of the methodology and
      must be published along with the results. With such a reliance on
      software, it is troubling that most scientists do not receive formal
      training in software development. Tools such as version control,
      continuous integration, and automated testing are routinely used in
      industry to ensure the correctness and robustness of software. However,
      many scientist do not even know of their existence (although efforts like
      Software Carpentry are having an impact on this issue). Publishing the
      source code is only the first step in creating an open-source project.
      For a project to grow it must provide documentation, participation
      guidelines, and a welcoming environment for new contributors. Expanding
      the project community is often more challenging than the technical
      aspects of software development. Maintainers must invest time to enforce
      the rules of the project and to onboard new members, which can be
      difficult to justify in the context of the “publish or perish” mentality.
      This problem will continue as long as software contributions are not
      recognized as valid scholarship by hiring and tenure committees.
      Furthermore, there are still unsolved problems in providing attribution
      for software contributions. Many journals and metrics of academic
      productivity do not recognize citations to sources other than traditional
      publications. Thus, some authors choose to publish an article about the
      software and use it as a citation marker. One issue with this approach is
      that updating the reference to include new contributors involves writing
      and publishing a new article. A better approach would be to cite a
      permanent archive of individual versions of the source code in services
      such as Zenodo. However, citations to these sources are not always
      recognized when computing citation metrics. In summary, the widespread
      development of reliable and robust open-source software relies on the
      creation of formal training programs in software development best
      practices and the recognition of software as a valid form of scholarship.

      The inner density distribution of the Earth can be inferred from
      disturbances in its gravitational field. However, accomplishing this is
      never easy. There are many possible parameterizations for the
      mathematical model, which is often non-linear. To make matters worse,
      gravity data alone do not contain enough information to obtain a unique
      and stable solution. One must add independent information to constrain
      the solution space, often in the form of regularization. Many different
      methods for performing this inference have been developed and research in
      this field is still active. Investigating new methodologies implies
      developing complex software, which often must be able to deal with sparse
      matrices and parallelism. I’ll present the open-source Python library
      Fatiando a Terra. It implements many of the components required for
      developing inversion methods, such as forward modeling, data processing
      and I/O, and regularization. I’ll also show how I used this library to

      O Fatiando a Terra é uma biblioteca feita na linguagem Python que tem
      como objetivo facilitar o trabalho de pesquisadores e professores na área
      geofísica. Os módulos da biblioteca foram planejados para facilitar a
      combinação de seus componentes de diversas formas. Por exemplo, o mesmo
      módulo de modelagem direta pode ser usado para produzir dados sintéticos,
      desenvolver um método de inversão ou como parte de uma interface gráfica
      interativa. Além disso, as funções da biblioteca podem ser combinadas com
      funções desenvolvidas pelo usuário e com as muitas bibliotecas
      científicas da linguagem Python. O módulo de problemas inversos
      automatiza grande parte da implementação de um novo método de inversão. O
      pesquisador implementa somente o cálculo de dados preditos e da matriz de
      sensibilidade, ambos reutilizando os diversos módulos de modelagem
      direta. Com essas duas funções, o usuário pode escolher livremente entre
      diversos métodos de optimização e regularização para executar sua
      inversão.
      Para o ensino de geofísica, a biblioteca pode ser combinada com a
      interatividade de outros programas, particularmente o IPython notebook
      (www.ipython.org). Conceitos difíceis de serem transmitidos em aula podem
      ser explorados pelos alunos de forma interativa, com botões, gráficos e
      animações. Por exemplo, para ensinar a reflexão e refração de ondas
      sísmicas, o professor pode utilizar simulações numéricas da propagação de
      ondas para produzir animações em tempo real. Outro exemplo é permitir aos
      alunos explorar como o campo geomagnético interage com um corpo geológico
      a diferentes latitudes para produzir uma anomalia magnética de campo
      total. Dessa forma, os alunos ganham experiência e intuição ao interagir
      com os resultados.
      A implementação de diversos métodos geofísicos em uma única biblioteca
      fornece a base necessária para a rápida criação de novas metodologias e
      material didático interativo. A maior parte da funcionalidade atual é
      para gravimetria e magnetometria, embora já exista um núcleo de sísmica e
      sismologia que está sendo desenvolvido. O projeto necessita de usuários e
      desenvolvedores para crescer e abranger os demais ramos da geofísica. O
      projeto é software livre e contribuições de qualquer forma são bem
      vindas.

      my open-source project Fatiando a Terra and how I'm using for teaching
      geophysics and doing my own research on inverse problems. It was also my

      Satellite observations of the gravity field have provided geophysicists
      with exceptionally dense and uniform coverage of data over vast areas.
      This enables regional or global scale high resolution geophysical
      investigations. Techniques like forward modeling and inversion of gravity
      anomalies are routinely used to investigate large geologic structures,
      such as large igneous provinces, suture zones, intracratonic basins, and
      the Moho. Accurately modeling such large structures requires taking the
      sphericity of the Earth into account. A reasonable approximation is to
      assume a spherical Earth and use spherical coordinates.
      In recent years, efforts have been made to advance forward modeling in
      spherical coordinates using tesseroids, particularly with respect to
      speed and accuracy. Conversely, traditional space domain inverse modeling
      methods have not yet been adapted to use spherical coordinates and
      tesseroids. In the literature there are a range of inversion methods that
      have been developed for Cartesian coordinates and right rectangular
      prisms. These include methods for estimating the relief of an interface,
      like the Moho or the basement of a sedimentary basin. Another category
      includes methods to estimate the density distribution in a medium. The
      latter apply many algorithms to solve the inverse problem, ranging from
      analytic solutions to random search methods as well as systematic search
      methods.
      We present an adaptation for tesseroids of the systematic search method
      of "planting anomalous densities". This method can be used to estimate
      the geometry of geologic structures. As prior information, it requires
      knowledge of the approximate densities and positions of the structures.
      The main advantage of this method is its computational efficiency,
      requiring little computer memory and processing time. We demonstrate the
      shortcomings and capabilities of this approach using applications to
      synthetic and field data. Performing the inversion of gravity and gravity
      gradient data, simultaneously or separately, is straight forward and
      requires no changes to the existing algorithm. Such feature makes it
      ideal for inverting the multicomponent gravity gradient data from the
      GOCE satellite.

      This was the first presentation that I made about Fatiando a Terra, a
      Python library for modeling and inversion in geophysics. The proceedings
      paper that accompanies this talk became the second chapter of my PhD
      thesis.
      </p>
    abstract: |
      Solid Earth geophysics is the science of using physical observations of
      the Earth to infer its inner structure. Generally, this is done with a
      variety of numerical modeling techniques and inverse problems. The
      development of new algorithms usually involves copy and pasting of code,
      which leads to errors and poor code reuse. Added to this is a modeling
      pipeline composed of various tools that don't communicate with each other
      (Fortran/C for computations, large complicated I/O files, Matlab/VTK for
      visualization, etc). Fatiando a Terra is a Python library that aims to
      unify the modeling pipeline inside of the Python language. This allows
      users to replace the traditional shell scripting with more versatile and
      powerful Python scripting. Together with the new IPython notebook,
      Fatiando a Terra can integrate all stages of the geophysical modeling
      process, like data pre-processing, inversion, statistical analysis, and
      visualization. However, the library can also be used for quickly
      developing stand-alone programs that can be integrated into existing
      pipelines. Plus, because functions inside Fatiando a Terra use a common
      data and mesh format, existing algorithms can be combined and new ideas
      can build upon existing functionality. This flexibility facilitates
      reproducible computations, prototyping of new algorithms, and interactive
      teaching exercises. Although the project has so far focused on potential
      field methods (gravity and magnetics), some numerical tools for other
      geophysical methods have been developed as well. The library already
      contains: fast implementations of forward modeling algorithms (using
      Numpy and Cython), generic inverse problem solvers, unified geometry
      classes (prism meshes, polygons, etc), functions to automate repetitive
      plotting tasks with Matplotlib (automatic griding, simple GUIs, picking,
      projections, etc) and Mayavi (automatic conversion of geometry classes to
      VTK, drawing continents, etc). In the future, we plan to continuously
      implement classic and state-of-the-art algorithms as well as sample
      problems to help teach geophysics.

      This talk presents an adaptation of the gravity-gradient inversion method
      I developed for my Masters degree dissertation "Robust 3D gravity
      gradient inversion by planting anomalous densities" to invert magnetic
      data.
      </p>
    abstract: |
      We present a new 3D magnetic inversion algorithm based on the
      computationally efficient method of planting anomalous densities. The
      algorithm consists of an iterative growth of the anomalous bodies around
      prismatic elements called "seeds". These seeds are user-specified and
      have known magnetizations. Thus, the seeds provide a way for the
      interpreter to specify the desired skeleton of the anomalous bodies. The
      inversion algorithm is computationally efficient due to various
      optimizations made possible by the iterative nature of the growth
      process. The control provided by the use of seeds allows one to test
      different hypothesis about the geometry and magnetization of targeted
      anomalous bodies. To demonstrate this capability, we applied our
      inversion method to the Morro do Engenho (ME) and A2 magnetic anomalies,
      central Brazil (Figure 1a). ME is an outcropping alkaline intrusion
      formed by dunites, peridotites and pyroxenites with known magnetization.
      A2 is a magnetic anomaly to the Northeast of ME and is thought to be a
      similar intrusion that is not outcropping. Therefore, a plausible
      hypothesis is that A2 has the same magnetization as ME. We tested this
      hypothesis by performing an inversion using a single seed for each body.
      Both seeds had the same magnetization. Figure 1b shows that the inversion
      produced residuals up to 2000 nT over A2 (i.e., a poor fit) and less than
      400 nT over ME (i.e., an acceptable fit). Figure 1c shows that ME is a
      compact outcropping body with bottom at approximately 5 km, which is in
      agreement with previous interpretations. However, the estimate produced
      by the inversion for A2 is outcropping and is not compact. In summary,
      the estimate for A2 provides a poor fit to the observations and is not in
      accordance with the geologic information. This leads to the conclusion
      that A2 does not have the same magnetization as ME. These results
      indicate the usefulness and capabilities of the inversion method here
      proposed.

      We have interpreted the airborne gravity gradiometry data from Carajás
      Mineral Province (CMP), Brazil, by using two different 3D inversion
      methods. Both inversion methods parameterized the Earth's subsurface into
      prismatic cells and estimate the 3D density-contrast distribution that
      retrieves an image of geologic sources subject to an acceptable data
      misfit. The first inversion method imposes smoothness on the solution by
      solving a linear system that minimizes an depth weighted L2 model
      objective function of density-contrast distribution. The second imposes
      compactness on the solution by using an iterative growth algorithm solved
      by a systematic search algorithm that accretes mass around user-specified
      prisms called “seeds”. Using these two inversion methods, the
      interpretation of full tensor gravity gradiometry data from an iron ore
      deposit in the area named N1 at CMP shows the consistent geometry and the
      depth of iron orebody. To date, the maximum depth of the iron orebody is
      assumed to be 200 m based on the maximum depth attained by the deepest
      well drilled in this study area. However, both inversion results exhibit
      a source whose maximum bottom depth is greater than 200 m. These
      results give rise two interpretations: i) the iron orebody may present
      its depth to the bottom greater than the maximum depth of 200 m attained
      by the deepest borehole; or ii) the iron orebody may be 200 m deep and
      the rocks below may be jaspilite whose density is close to that of soft
      hematite.

    abstract: |
      We present an improvement to the method of 3D gravity gradient inversion
      by planting anomalous densities. This method estimates a density-contrast
      distribution defined on a grid of right-rectangular prisms. Instead of
      solving large equation systems, the method uses a systematic search
      algorithm to grow the solution, one prism at a time, around
      user-specified prisms called "seeds". These seeds have known density
      contrasts and the solution is constrained to be concentrated around the
      seeds as well as have their density contrasts. Thus, prior geologic and
      geophysical information are incorporated into the inverse problem through
      the seeds. However, this leads to a strong dependence of the solution on
      the correct location, density contrast, and number of seeds used. Our
      improvement to this method consists of using the "shape-of-anomaly"
      data-misfit function in conjunction with the l2-norm data-misfit
      function. The shape-of-anomaly function measures the different in shape
      between the observed and predicted data and is insensitive to differences
      in amplitude. Tests on synthetic and real data show that the improved
      method not only has an increased robustness with respect to the number of
      seeds and their locations, but also provides a better fit of the observed
      data.

    abstract: |
      Forward modeling of potential fields is a useful way to incorporate the
      interpreter's knowledge about the geology of the interpretation area into
      the model. However, this can be a very tedious task. This is specially
      true when modeling in 3D and trying to fit multiple components, e.g., in
      gravity gradiometry. The interpreter is required to simultaneously
      supervise the data fit and the construction of geologically realistic 3D
      bodies. This problem is partially solved by methods of geophysical
      inversion, which automatically fit the data. Conversely, inverse problems
      introduce other challenges of their own. Most geophysical inverse
      problems are ill-posed because their solutions are neither unique nor
      stable. Thus, they require the introduction of prior information, usually
      through regularizing functions. Moreover, 3D inverse problems are very
      computationally expensive. Recent developments in potential field
      inversion have proposed different regularizing functions to transform the
      ill-posed problem into a well-posed one. Also, several techniques, like
      data compression and parallel computation, have been applied to overcome
      the computational complexity. We call attention to the method of
      potential field inversion by planting anomalous densities. This method
      uses an iterative algorithm to automatically grow the anomalous bodies
      around user-specified prismatic elements called "seeds", which have fixed
      density contrasts and positions. These seeds provide a first estimate of
      the skeletal outlines of the presumed anomalous bodies. Then, the
      inversion iteratively concentrates mass around this "skeleton" in a way
      that both fits the observed data and yields compact bodies. Therefore,
      the interpreter can easily impose prior information on the inversion
      through the seeds. The interpreter needs only to supply a few seeds that
      specify the sources' skeleton, eliminating the exhaustive task of
      specifying the complete geometry of multiple sources. Moreover, the
      interpreter is liberated from the time- consuming procedure of yielding a
      reasonable fit to the data. Due to its high computational efficiency, the
      method of planting anomalous densities can be used to quickly test
      geologic hypothesis of different locations and density contrasts for
      presumed sources. To test a hypothesis, one would choose the locations
      and density contrasts of the seeds accordingly and verify if the
      inversion result is able to fit the observed data. If it is not able,
      then the hypothesis can be rejected and a new one can be formulated and
      tested. Otherwise, there is no reason to reject the hypothesis on the
      basis of the geophysical data. Thus, the method can be viewed as a an
      enhanced forward modeling. The method of planting anomalous densities can
      be used with both gravity and gravity gradient data. This makes it an
      ideal tool to interpret compact geologic bodies using the new generation
      GOCE data. We present applications to synthetic and real data that
      illustrate the usefulness of our method.

      This poster and conference proceedings present the results and methods
      after the 1.0 release of Tesseroids. Version 1.0 was a complete re-write
      of the original Python code in the C language. This work was made
      possible by professor Carla Braitenberg. She funded me to spend a month
      at the University of Trieste, Italy, and re-write the software from
      scratch. What followed was a much faster and more robust
      program.

      This version also featured the first iteration of the adaptive
      discretization presented in the paper "Tesseroids: forward modeling
      gravitational fields in spherical coordinates" and my PhD thesis.

      The new observations of GOCE present a challenge to develop new
      calculation methods that take into account the sphericity of the Earth.
      We address this problem by using a discretization with a series of
      tesseroids. There is no closed formula giving the gravitational fields of
      the tesseroid and numerical integration methods must be used, such as the
      Gauss Legendre Cubature (GLC). A problem that arises is that the
      computation times with the tesseroids are high. Therefore, it is
      important to optimize the computations while maintaining the desired
      accuracy. This optimization was done using an adaptive computation scheme
      that consists of using a fixed GLC order and recursively subdividing the
      tesseroids. We have obtained an optimum ratio between the size of the
      tesseroid and its distance from the computation point. Furthermore, we
      show that this size-to-distance ratio is different for the gravitational
      attraction than for the gravity gradient tensor.

      This is a presentation of the methods behind the open-source software
      Tesseroids. The algorithms implemented in the software have since been
      updated (see the paper "Tesseroids: forward modeling gravitational fields
      in spherical coordinates") and have become a part of my PhD thesis. The
      content of this presentation is a summary of my Bachelor's degree thesis.

      The GOCE satellite mission has the objective of measuring the Earth's
      gravitational field with an unprecedented accuracy through the
      measurement of the gravity gradient tensor (GGT). One of the several
      applications of this new gravity data set is to study the geodynamics of
      the lithospheric plates, where the flat Earth approximation may not be
      ideal and the Earth's curvature should be taken into account. In such a
      case, the Earth could be modeled using tesseroids, also called spherical
      prisms, instead of the conventional rectangular prisms. The GGT due to a
      tesseroid is calculated using numerical integration methods, such as the
      Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GLQ), as already proposed by Asgharzadeh et
      al. (2007) and Wild-Pfeiffer (2008). We present a computer program for
      the direct computation of the GGT caused by a tesseroid using the GLQ.
      The accuracy of this implementation was evaluated by comparing its
      results with the result of analytical formulas for the special case of a
      spherical cap with computation point located at one of the poles. The GGT
      due to the topographic masses of the Parana basin (SE Brazil) was
      estimated at 260km altitude in an attempt to quantify this effect on the
      GOCE gravity data. The digital elevation model ETOPO1 (Amante and Eakins,
      2009) between 40º W and 65º W and 10º S and 35º S, which includes the
      Paraná Basin, was used to generate a tesseroid model of the topography
      with grid spacing of 10' x 10' and a constant density of 2670 kg/m3. The
      largest amplitude observed was on the second vertical derivative
      component (-0.05 to 1.20 Eötvos) in regions of rough topography, such as
      that along the eastern Brazilian continental margins. These results
      indicate that the GGT due to topographic masses may have amplitudes of
      the same order of magnitude as the GGT due to density anomalies within
      the crust and mantle.

      This is the first poster I presented about my undergraduate research on
      forward modeling with tesseroids (spherical prisms). This would
      eventually become the software Tesseroids and a part of my PhD thesis.

      A ESA (European Space Agency) planeja lançar no outono de 2008 a missão
      GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer). A
      missão foi planejada para medir o campo gravitacional da Terra com
      acurácia e resolução sem precedentes. Para isso, fará uso de um
      gradiômetro de gravidade eletrostático que consiste de três pares de
      acelerômetros idênticos mutuamente ortogonais. O GOCE fornecerá dados do
      tensor gradiente da gravidade (TGG) a uma altitude de órbita de
      aproximadamente 250 km.
      Está sendo desenvolvido um programa computacional para analisar dados do
      TGG sobre as bacias sedimentares brasileiras. O programa utilizará o
      método da Quadratura Gauss-Legendre para efetuar a modelagem direta do
      TGG gerado por feições ou corpos geológicos com geometria esférica. A
      modelagem será feita discretizando o corpo por tesseróides, também
      denominados prismas esféricos. Os tesseróides são segmentos de uma casca
      esférica de espessura finita limitados por linhas de grade geográficas. A
      geometria dos tesseróides possibilita a construção de modelos levando em
      conta a curvatura da Terra. Isto se torna importante na modelagem de
      corpos geológicos com grande extensão lateral, como por exemplo, a bacia
      do Paraná. Será criado um modelo de densidade desta bacia a partir de
      dados de poços e dados sísmicos e utilizaremos o programa desenvolvido
      para obter estimativas do TGG. As estimativas serão comparadas com os
      futuros dados do GOCE na tentativa de separar o componente gravimétrico
      associado às variações de densidade na parte mais profunda da bacia.

      This is the first poster I ever made. It was about my first undergraduate
      research project at the paleomagnetism lab at the Universidade de São
      Paulo. The project lasted for a year and I was able to go to the field
      and collect samples from Cambrian dikes in Northeastern Brazil.

      I can't even find an abstract for this but I like to share it anyway.
      It's kind of nostalgic.
