    Gravimetry is a routine part of the geophysicists toolset, historically
    used in geophysics following the geodetic definitions of gravity
    anomalies and their related “reductions”. Several authors have shown that
    the geodetic concept of a gravity anomaly does not align with goals of
    gravimetry in geophysics (the investigation of anomalous density
    distributions). Much of this confusion likely stems from the lack of
    widely available tools for performing the corrections needed to arrive at
    a geophysically meaningful gravity disturbance. For example, free-air
    corrections are completely unnecessary since analytical expressions for
    theoretical gravity at any point have existed for over a decade. Since
    this is not easily done in a spreadsheet or short script, modern tools
    for processing and modelling gravity data for geophysics are needed.
    These tools must be trustworthy (i.e., extensively tested) and designed
    with software development and geophysical best practices in mind.
    We present the Python libraries Harmonica and Boule, which are part of
    the <a href="https://www.fatiando.org">Fatiando a Terra</a> project. Both
    tools are open-source under the permissive BSD license and are developed
    in the open by a community of geoscientists and programmers.
    Harmonica provides tools for processing, forward modelling, and inversion
    of gravity and magnetic data. The first release of Harmonica was focused
    on implementing methods for processing and interpolation with the
    equivalent source technique, as well as forward modelling with
    right-rectangular prisms, point sources, and tesseroids. Current work is
    directed towards implementing a processing pipeline for gravity data,
    including topographic corrections in Cartesian and spherical coordinates,
    atmospheric corrections, and more. The software is still in early stages
    of development and design and would benefit greatly from community
    involvement and feedback.
    Boule implements reference ellipsoids (including oblate ellipsoids,
    spheres, and soon triaxial ellipsoids), conversions between ellipsoidal
    and geocentric spherical coordinates, and normal gravity calculations
    using analytical solutions for gravity fields at any point outside of the
    ellipsoid. It includes ellipsoids for the Earth as well as other
    planetary bodies in the solar system, like Mars, the Moon, Venus, and
    Mercury. This enables the calculation of gravity disturbances for Earth
    and planetary data without the need for free-air corrections. Boule was
    created out of the shared needs of Harmonica,
    <a href="https://github.com/SHTOOLS">SHTools</a>,
    and <a href="https://github.com/ioshchepkov/pygeoid">pygeoid</a> and is
    developed with input from developers of these projects.
    We welcome participation from the wider geophysical community,
    irrespective of programming skill level and experience, and are actively
    searching for interested developers and users to get involved in shaping
    the future of these projects.

    In particular, applying state-of-the-art cross-validation strategies to
    estimate interpolation accuracy and tune equivalent-source parameters.
  abstract: |
    We investigate the use of cross-validation (CV) techniques to estimate
    the accuracy of equivalent-source (also known as equivalent-layer) models
    for interpolation and processing of potential-field data. Our preliminary
    results indicate that some common CV algorithms (e.g., random
    permutations and k-folds) tend to overestimate the accuracy. We have
    found that blocked CV methods, where the data are split along spatial
    blocks instead of randomly, provide more conservative and realistic
    accuracy estimates. Beyond evaluating an equivalent-source model's
    performance, cross-validation can be used to automatically determine
    configuration parameters, like source depth and amount of regularization,
    that maximize prediction accuracy and avoid over-fitting.
    Widely used in gravity and magnetic data processing, the
    equivalent-source technique consists of a linear model (usually point
    sources) used to predict the observed field at arbitrary locations.
    Upward-continuation, interpolation, gradient calculations, leveling, and
    reduction-to-the-pole can be performed simultaneously by using the model
    to make predictions (i.e., forward modelling). Likewise, the use of
    linear models to make predictions is the backbone of many machine
    learning (ML) applications. The predictive performance of ML models is
    usually evaluated through cross-validation, in which the data are split
    (usually randomly) into a training set and a validation set. Models are
    fit on the training set and their predictions are evaluated using the
    validation set using a goodness-of-fit metric, like the mean square error
    or the R² coefficient of determination. Many cross-validation methods
    exist in the literature, varying in how the data are split and how this
    process is repeated. Prior research from the statistical modelling of
    ecological data suggests that prediction accuracy is usually
    overestimated by traditional CV methods when the data are spatially
    auto-correlated. This issue can be mitigated by splitting the data along
    spatial blocks rather than randomly. We conducted experiments on
    synthetic gravity data to investigate the use of traditional and blocked
    CV methods in equivalent-source interpolation. We found that the
    overestimation problem also occurs and that more conservative accuracy
    estimates are obtained when applying blocked versions of random
    permutations and k-fold. Further studies need to be conducted to
    generalize these findings to upward-continuation, reduction-to-the-pole,
    and derivative calculation.
    Open-source software implementations of the equivalent-source and blocked
    cross-validation (in progress) methods are available in the Python
    libraries Harmonica and Verde, which are part of the Fatiando a Terra
    project.

    This is an update on the progress we've made in
    <a href="https://www.pygmt.org">PyGMT</a>.
    There are examples of some of the new features implemented by myself and
    contributors, as well as the main problems we're facing and a call for
    volunteers.
    The main feedback we got during the meeting is that the API is not very
    intuitive for people unfamiliar with GMT (which I expect to be the
    majority of users). This has got me thinking of ways to move away from
    the direct mapping of GMT modules to PyGMT functions. Instead, we should
    implement something that makes sense in Python and call whatever GMT
    modules we need to get that done under the hood.
  abstract: |
    For almost 30 years, the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) have provided the
    Earth, Ocean, and Planetary Sciences with an open-source toolbox for
    processing and visualizing spatial data (bathymetry, gravity, magnetic,
    earthquake focal mechanisms, and more). In many fields, GMT is the de
    facto standard for creating high-resolution publication quality maps,
    figures, and animations. Since version 5, GMT has provided a C language
    Application Programming Interface (API) that allows other programs to
    access its core functionality. We are using this bridge to develop
    <a href="https://www.pygmt.org">PyGMT</a>
    (formerly GMT/Python), an open-source library that allows
    users of the Python programming language to leverage the almost thirty
    years of continuous GMT development. PyGMT is designed to integrate with
    the existing scientific Python ecosystem, including popular packages such
    as numpy, pandas, and xarray. PyGMT integrates seamlessly with the
    Jupyter notebook, allowing high-quality figures to be generated
    interactively both in a personal computer and in cloud computing
    environments compatible with Jupyter. We will present the design and
    usage of the software package, latest developments and updates, and
    lessons learned during its implementation.

    This is update on my GPS interpolation work (see the AOGS2018 presentation).
    The implementation is entirely based on the
    <a href="https://www.fatiando.org/verde">Verde library</a> (there is an
    <a href="/blog/introducing-verde.html">introduction to what it can do on
    the blog</a>). This was the first test of the Verde API and I'm glad to
    say that it passed with flying colors. Implementing the new methods was
    very straight forward and all the tools in Verde made the entire data
    processing and model selection pipeline simple and easy.
  abstract: |
    GPS/GNSS measurements of deformation have high accuracy and temporal
    resolution but are spatially sparse. Conversely, InSAR provides great
    spatial resolution but is limited by the satellite look angle,
    atmospheric noise, and the delay between repeat passes. The sparse GPS
    data often need to be interpolated on regular grids to be used as
    constraints during InSAR processing or to calculate strain rates. The
    interpolation is routinely done separately for each component of the
    velocity field using minimum curvature or specialized geostatistical
    algorithms. Recently, a joint interpolation of the horizontal components
    has been proposed. It estimates forces on a thin elastic sheet that fit
    the observed data and subsequently uses the estimated model to predict
    data on regular grids or arbitrary points. The Green’s functions for the
    physical model serve as a coupling between the two vector components
    through elasticity theory. We propose an extension of this method to 3D,
    using the elastic Green’s functions to couple the horizontal and vertical
    components. This enables the inclusion of vector data projected in
    arbitrary directions, such as InSAR line-of-sight velocities. The degree
    of coupling can be controlled through the Poisson’s ratio of the medium.
    We apply damping regularization to smooth the model and avoid
    instabilities in the inverse problem. Furthermore, we automatically
    select optimal values for the Poisson’s ratio and regularization
    parameter through cross-validation, which is common in machine learning
    applications. We compare the performance of the coupled model with
    uncoupled alternatives to grid 2- and 3-component GPS velocities and
    calculate derivatives through finite-differences approximations. We will
    present preliminary results from applications to GPS data from the
    Himalayas and the calibration of InSAR data products. A future goal is to
    integrate InSAR line-of-sight velocities in a joint interpolation with
    GPS velocities.

    Ocean Sciences to process and visualize geographic data. At SciPy 2017,
    we presented the project goals and an initial prototype. The feedback
    received led to improvements in the design of the library, mainly the
    creation of an object-oriented API. We will present the newest
    developments including support for numpy arrays and pandas Dataframes,
    interactive visualization in the Jupyter notebook using NASA WorldWind,
    and more. Once again, we seek feedback from the community to guide us

    This talk is about some early results from a collaboration me and Paul
    have with <a href="http://topex.ucsd.edu/sandwell/">David Sandwell</a>.
    The project was started by Paul and Dave as a follow up to their
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2016GL070340">2016 paper about
    interpolating 2D vector data</a>.
    We're expanding it into 3D and ironing out some kinks in the methodology.
    I picked it up at the beginning of the year and have been slowly trying
    things out. It was a great chance to play with some tools from machine
    learning since this is a supervised prediction problem. Unlike most
    geophysical inversion, we're not really interested in the estimated
    parameters themselves. They are only a means to predict new values (on a
    regular grid in the case of gridding). I started implementing the tools I
    would need in a Python library called
    <a href="https://github.com/fatiando/verde">Verde</a>, which served as
    the basis for the results shown in the presentation.

    Vertical ground motion at fault systems can be difficult to detect due to
    their small amplitude and contamination from non-tectonic sources, such
    as ground water loading. However, it may play an important role in our
    understanding of the earthquake cycle and the associated seismic hazards.
    Ground motion measurements from GPS are often sparse and must be
    interpolated onto a regular grid (e.g., for computing strain rate),
    ideally taking into account the varying degrees of uncertainty of the
    data. Traditionally, each vector component is interpolated separately
    using minimum curvature or biharmonic spline methods. Recently, a joint
    interpolation of the two horizontal components has been developed using
    the Green's functions for a point force deforming a thin elastic sheet.
    The elasticity constraints provide a coupling between the two vector
    components and lead to improved results because the underlying physics of
    the method approximately matches that of the GPS observations. We propose
    an expansion of this method into 3D in order to incorporate vertical GPS
    velocity measurements. To smooth the model and avoid singularities, we
    formulate the interpolation as a weighted least-squares inverse problem
    with damping regularization. Optimal values of the regularization
    parameter and the Poisson's ratio of the elastic medium are determined
    through K-fold cross-validation, a technique often used in machine
    learning for model selection. Additionally, the cross-validation provides
    a measure of the accuracy of model predictions and eliminates the need
    for manual configuration. The computational load of the inversion is
    lessened by imposing a cutoff distance to the Green's functions
    computations, which makes the sensitivity matrix sparse. We will present
    preliminary results from an application to EarthScope GPS data from the
    San Andreas Fault system. In the future, we aim to develop a joint
    inversion of 3D GPS and InSAR line-of-sight velocities to improve data
    coverage.

    It showcases the new support for <code>gmt.Figure.grdimage</code>, the
    built-in Earth relief datasets in GMT6, and plotting vectors with
    <code>gmt.Figure.plot</code>. I wanted to have a more sophisticated
    showcase of <code>grdimage</code> but I ran into some bugs before the
    conference and wasn't able to finish it in time. Still, I'm amazed at how
    few lines of code are required to make the figure in the poster. The more

    The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) are used throughout the geosciences to
    processes spatial data and create publication quality data
    visualizations, such as contour maps, earthquake focal mechanism
    solutions, and animations. The software is programmed in the C language
    and is accessed through a command-line interface. Recent versions of GMT
    also provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows
    access to the core functionality from other programming languages,
    potentially expanding the reach of GMT far beyond the current user base.
    A GMT toolbox for Matlab using the API has already been released, and an
    experimental interface from the Julia language is being developed. We are
    building a software library to interface GMT with the Python programming
    language. Popularity of Python has grown steadily in the Earth Sciences
    due to its simplicity and powerful set of scientific libraries. However,
    there is still great need for the geospatial processing and mapping
    capabilities of GMT. The GMT/Python library integrates with the
    scientific Python ecosystem through the support of common Python data
    types: numpy "ndarrays" and Pandas "DataFrames" for tabular data and
    xarray "Datasets" for grids. We have also implemented support for the
    Jupyter notebooks, a web-based interactive computing environment. These
    features will help make GMT more accessible to students and professional
    geoscientists who lack an extensive background in Unix tools and shell
    scripting. GMT/Python is an open-source project in early stages of
    development. The current focus is on the implementation of a robust set
    of core routines that implement the bridge between Python and GMT. Later,
    we will expand the library to cover the entire functionality of GMT. A
    first release is predicted for the late 2018. The latest documentation
    and source code can be accessed through the website
    <a href="http://www.pygmt.org/">www.pygmt.org</a>.

    This is the second conference presentation about my work on GMT/Python.
    The first was my talk at SciPy 2017. I mostly made progress establishing
    the basis for the software: documentation build, CIs, and the code to
    talk to the C API. I hadn't presented a poster in 3 years and I really
    enjoyed designing this one. The background image was generated using
    GMT/Python (see the code in the poster). It's a clean design and I like
    how it turned out.
  abstract: |
    Figures generated by The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) are present in
    countless publications across the Earth sciences. The command-line
    interface of GMT lends the tool its flexibility but also creates a
    barrier to entry for beginners. Meanwhile, adoption of the Python
    programming language has grown across the scientific community. This
    growth is largely due to the simplicity and low barrier to entry of the
    language and its ecosystem of tools. Thus, it is not surprising that
    there have been at least three attempts to create Python interfaces for
    GMT: gmtpy, pygmt, and PyGMT. None of these projects are currently active
    and, with the exception of pygmt, they do not use the GMT Application
    Programming Interface (API) introduced in GMT 5.  The two main Python
    libraries for plotting data on maps are the matplotlib Basemap toolkit
    (matplotlib.org/basemap) and Cartopy (scitools.org.uk/cartopy), both of
    which rely on matplotlib (matplotlib.org) as the backend for generating
    the figures. Basemap is known to have limitations and is being
    discontinued.  Cartopy is an improvement over Basemap but is still bound
    by the speed and memory constraints of matplotlib. We present a new
    Python interface for GMT (GMT/Python) that makes use of the GMT API and
    of new features being developed for the upcoming GMT 6 release. The
    GMT/Python library is designed according to the norms and styles of the
    Python community. The library integrates with the scientific Python
    ecosystem by using the “virtual files” from the GMT API to implement
    input and output of Python data types (numpy “ndarray” for tabular data
    and xarray “Dataset” for grids). Other features include an
    object-oriented interface for creating figures, the ability to display
    figures in the Jupyter notebook, and descriptive aliases for GMT
    arguments (e.g., “region” instead of “R” and “projection” instead of
    “J”). GMT/Python can also serve as a backend for developing new
    high-level interfaces, which can help make GMT more accessible to
    beginners and more intuitive for Python users. GMT/Python is an
    open-source project hosted on GitHub and is in early stages of
    development. A first release will accompany the release of  GMT 6, which
    is expected for early 2018.

    Satellite observations of the gravity field have provided geophysicists
    with exceptionally dense and uniform coverage of data over vast areas.
    This enables regional or global scale high resolution geophysical
    investigations. Techniques like forward modeling and inversion of gravity
    anomalies are routinely used to investigate large geologic structures,
    such as large igneous provinces, suture zones, intracratonic basins, and
    the Moho. Accurately modeling such large structures requires taking the
    sphericity of the Earth into account. A reasonable approximation is to
    assume a spherical Earth and use spherical coordinates.
    In recent years, efforts have been made to advance forward modeling in
    spherical coordinates using tesseroids, particularly with respect to
    speed and accuracy. Conversely, traditional space domain inverse modeling
    methods have not yet been adapted to use spherical coordinates and
    tesseroids. In the literature there are a range of inversion methods that
    have been developed for Cartesian coordinates and right rectangular
    prisms. These include methods for estimating the relief of an interface,
    like the Moho or the basement of a sedimentary basin. Another category
    includes methods to estimate the density distribution in a medium. The
    latter apply many algorithms to solve the inverse problem, ranging from
    analytic solutions to random search methods as well as systematic search
    methods.
    We present an adaptation for tesseroids of the systematic search method
    of "planting anomalous densities". This method can be used to estimate
    the geometry of geologic structures. As prior information, it requires
    knowledge of the approximate densities and positions of the structures.
    The main advantage of this method is its computational efficiency,
    requiring little computer memory and processing time. We demonstrate the
    shortcomings and capabilities of this approach using applications to
    synthetic and field data. Performing the inversion of gravity and gravity
    gradient data, simultaneously or separately, is straight forward and
    requires no changes to the existing algorithm. Such feature makes it
    ideal for inverting the multicomponent gravity gradient data from the
    GOCE satellite.

    This was the first presentation that I made about Fatiando a Terra, a
    Python library for modeling and inversion in geophysics. The proceedings
    paper that accompanies this talk became the second chapter of my PhD
    thesis.
  abstract: |
    Solid Earth geophysics is the science of using physical observations of
    the Earth to infer its inner structure. Generally, this is done with a
    variety of numerical modeling techniques and inverse problems. The
    development of new algorithms usually involves copy and pasting of code,
    which leads to errors and poor code reuse. Added to this is a modeling
    pipeline composed of various tools that don't communicate with each other
    (Fortran/C for computations, large complicated I/O files, Matlab/VTK for
    visualization, etc). Fatiando a Terra is a Python library that aims to
    unify the modeling pipeline inside of the Python language. This allows
    users to replace the traditional shell scripting with more versatile and
    powerful Python scripting. Together with the new IPython notebook,
    Fatiando a Terra can integrate all stages of the geophysical modeling
    process, like data pre-processing, inversion, statistical analysis, and
    visualization. However, the library can also be used for quickly
    developing stand-alone programs that can be integrated into existing
    pipelines. Plus, because functions inside Fatiando a Terra use a common
    data and mesh format, existing algorithms can be combined and new ideas
    can build upon existing functionality. This flexibility facilitates
    reproducible computations, prototyping of new algorithms, and interactive
    teaching exercises. Although the project has so far focused on potential
    field methods (gravity and magnetics), some numerical tools for other
    geophysical methods have been developed as well. The library already
    contains: fast implementations of forward modeling algorithms (using
    Numpy and Cython), generic inverse problem solvers, unified geometry
    classes (prism meshes, polygons, etc), functions to automate repetitive
    plotting tasks with Matplotlib (automatic griding, simple GUIs, picking,
    projections, etc) and Mayavi (automatic conversion of geometry classes to
    VTK, drawing continents, etc). In the future, we plan to continuously
    implement classic and state-of-the-art algorithms as well as sample
    problems to help teach geophysics.

    As you may have noticed, there is an error in the title. We do not, in
    fact, invert magnetic data using density anomalies. This illustrates the
    perils of copy-pasting combined with a looming deadline.
    This talk presents an adaptation of the gravity-gradient inversion method
    I developed for my Masters degree dissertation "Robust 3D gravity
    gradient inversion by planting anomalous densities" to invert magnetic
    data.
  abstract: |
    We present a new 3D magnetic inversion algorithm based on the
    computationally efficient method of planting anomalous densities. The
    algorithm consists of an iterative growth of the anomalous bodies around
    prismatic elements called "seeds". These seeds are user-specified and
    have known magnetizations. Thus, the seeds provide a way for the
    interpreter to specify the desired skeleton of the anomalous bodies. The
    inversion algorithm is computationally efficient due to various
    optimizations made possible by the iterative nature of the growth
    process. The control provided by the use of seeds allows one to test
    different hypothesis about the geometry and magnetization of targeted
    anomalous bodies. To demonstrate this capability, we applied our
    inversion method to the Morro do Engenho (ME) and A2 magnetic anomalies,
    central Brazil (Figure 1a). ME is an outcropping alkaline intrusion
    formed by dunites, peridotites and pyroxenites with known magnetization.
    A2 is a magnetic anomaly to the Northeast of ME and is thought to be a
    similar intrusion that is not outcropping. Therefore, a plausible
    hypothesis is that A2 has the same magnetization as ME. We tested this
    hypothesis by performing an inversion using a single seed for each body.
    Both seeds had the same magnetization. Figure 1b shows that the inversion
    produced residuals up to 2000 nT over A2 (i.e., a poor fit) and less than
    400 nT over ME (i.e., an acceptable fit). Figure 1c shows that ME is a
    compact outcropping body with bottom at approximately 5 km, which is in
    agreement with previous interpretations. However, the estimate produced
    by the inversion for A2 is outcropping and is not compact. In summary,
    the estimate for A2 provides a poor fit to the observations and is not in
    accordance with the geologic information. This leads to the conclusion
    that A2 does not have the same magnetization as ME. These results
    indicate the usefulness and capabilities of the inversion method here
    proposed.

    He used my planting inversion method on data from his research area in
    central Brazil. He couldn't make it to the meeting so I ended up giving
    the talk on his behalf.
  abstract: |
    We have interpreted the airborne gravity gradiometry data from Carajás
    Mineral Province (CMP), Brazil, by using two different 3D inversion
    methods. Both inversion methods parameterized the Earth's subsurface into
    prismatic cells and estimate the 3D density-contrast distribution that
    retrieves an image of geologic sources subject to an acceptable data
    misfit. The first inversion method imposes smoothness on the solution by
    solving a linear system that minimizes an depth weighted L2 model
    objective function of density-contrast distribution. The second imposes
    compactness on the solution by using an iterative growth algorithm solved
    by a systematic search algorithm that accretes mass around user-specified
    prisms called “seeds”. Using these two inversion methods, the
    interpretation of full tensor gravity gradiometry data from an iron ore
    deposit in the area named N1 at CMP shows the consistent geometry and the
    depth of iron orebody. To date, the maximum depth of the iron orebody is
    assumed to be 200 m based on the maximum depth attained by the deepest
    well drilled in this study area. However, both inversion results exhibit
    a source whose maximum bottom depth is greater than 200 m. These
    results give rise two interpretations: i) the iron orebody may present
    its depth to the bottom greater than the maximum depth of 200 m attained
    by the deepest borehole; or ii) the iron orebody may be 200 m deep and
    the rocks below may be jaspilite whose density is close to that of soft
    hematite.

    This talk is about an improvement to the method described in the paper
    "Robust 3D gravity gradient inversion by planting anomalous densities".
  abstract: |
    We present an improvement to the method of 3D gravity gradient inversion
    by planting anomalous densities. This method estimates a density-contrast
    distribution defined on a grid of right-rectangular prisms. Instead of
    solving large equation systems, the method uses a systematic search
    algorithm to grow the solution, one prism at a time, around
    user-specified prisms called "seeds". These seeds have known density
    contrasts and the solution is constrained to be concentrated around the
    seeds as well as have their density contrasts. Thus, prior geologic and
    geophysical information are incorporated into the inverse problem through
    the seeds. However, this leads to a strong dependence of the solution on
    the correct location, density contrast, and number of seeds used. Our
    improvement to this method consists of using the "shape-of-anomaly"
    data-misfit function in conjunction with the l2-norm data-misfit
    function. The shape-of-anomaly function measures the different in shape
    between the observed and predicted data and is insensitive to differences
    in amplitude. Tests on synthetic and real data show that the improved
    method not only has an increased robustness with respect to the number of
    seeds and their locations, but also provides a better fit of the observed
    data.

    Rapid 3D inversion of gravity and gravity gradient data to test geologic
    hypotheses

  abstract: |
    Forward modeling of potential fields is a useful way to incorporate the
    interpreter's knowledge about the geology of the interpretation area into
    the model. However, this can be a very tedious task. This is specially
    true when modeling in 3D and trying to fit multiple components, e.g., in
    gravity gradiometry. The interpreter is required to simultaneously
    supervise the data fit and the construction of geologically realistic 3D
    bodies. This problem is partially solved by methods of geophysical
    inversion, which automatically fit the data. Conversely, inverse problems
    introduce other challenges of their own. Most geophysical inverse
    problems are ill-posed because their solutions are neither unique nor
    stable. Thus, they require the introduction of prior information, usually
    through regularizing functions. Moreover, 3D inverse problems are very
    computationally expensive. Recent developments in potential field
    inversion have proposed different regularizing functions to transform the
    ill-posed problem into a well-posed one. Also, several techniques, like
    data compression and parallel computation, have been applied to overcome
    the computational complexity. We call attention to the method of
    potential field inversion by planting anomalous densities. This method
    uses an iterative algorithm to automatically grow the anomalous bodies
    around user-specified prismatic elements called "seeds", which have fixed
    density contrasts and positions. These seeds provide a first estimate of
    the skeletal outlines of the presumed anomalous bodies. Then, the
    inversion iteratively concentrates mass around this "skeleton" in a way
    that both fits the observed data and yields compact bodies. Therefore,
    the interpreter can easily impose prior information on the inversion
    through the seeds. The interpreter needs only to supply a few seeds that
    specify the sources' skeleton, eliminating the exhaustive task of
    specifying the complete geometry of multiple sources. Moreover, the
    interpreter is liberated from the time- consuming procedure of yielding a
    reasonable fit to the data. Due to its high computational efficiency, the
    method of planting anomalous densities can be used to quickly test
    geologic hypothesis of different locations and density contrasts for
    presumed sources. To test a hypothesis, one would choose the locations
    and density contrasts of the seeds accordingly and verify if the
    inversion result is able to fit the observed data. If it is not able,
    then the hypothesis can be rejected and a new one can be formulated and
    tested. Otherwise, there is no reason to reject the hypothesis on the
    basis of the geophysical data. Thus, the method can be viewed as a an
    enhanced forward modeling. The method of planting anomalous densities can
    be used with both gravity and gravity gradient data. This makes it an
    ideal tool to interpret compact geologic bodies using the new generation
    GOCE data. We present applications to synthetic and real data that
    illustrate the usefulness of our method.

    prisms for the accretion are chosen by systematically searching the set
    of current neighboring prisms. Therefore, this approach allows that the
    columns of the Jacobian matrix be calculated on demand, which greatly
    reduces the demand of computer memory and processing time. Tests on

    Quadrilátero Ferrífero, southeastern Brazil, confirmed the ability of our

    This poster and conference proceedings present the results and methods
    after the 1.0 release of Tesseroids. Version 1.0 was a complete re-write
    of the original Python code in the C language. This work was made
    possible by professor Carla Braitenberg. She funded me to spend a month
    at the University of Trieste, Italy, and re-write the software from
    scratch. What followed was a much faster and more robust
    program.
    This version also featured the first iteration of the adaptive
    discretization presented in the paper "Tesseroids: forward modeling
    gravitational fields in spherical coordinates" and my PhD thesis.
  abstract: |
    The new observations of GOCE present a challenge to develop new
    calculation methods that take into account the sphericity of the Earth.
    We address this problem by using a discretization with a series of
    tesseroids. There is no closed formula giving the gravitational fields of
    the tesseroid and numerical integration methods must be used, such as the
    Gauss Legendre Cubature (GLC). A problem that arises is that the
    computation times with the tesseroids are high. Therefore, it is
    important to optimize the computations while maintaining the desired
    accuracy. This optimization was done using an adaptive computation scheme
    that consists of using a fixed GLC order and recursively subdividing the
    tesseroids. We have obtained an optimum ratio between the size of the
    tesseroid and its distance from the computation point. Furthermore, we
    show that this size-to-distance ratio is different for the gravitational
    attraction than for the gravity gradient tensor.

    in spherical coordinates") and have become a part of my PhD thesis. The
    content of this presentation is a summary of my Bachelor's degree thesis.
  abstract: |
    The GOCE satellite mission has the objective of measuring the Earth's
    gravitational field with an unprecedented accuracy through the
    measurement of the gravity gradient tensor (GGT). One of the several
    applications of this new gravity data set is to study the geodynamics of
    the lithospheric plates, where the flat Earth approximation may not be
    ideal and the Earth's curvature should be taken into account. In such a
    case, the Earth could be modeled using tesseroids, also called spherical
    prisms, instead of the conventional rectangular prisms. The GGT due to a
    tesseroid is calculated using numerical integration methods, such as the
    Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GLQ), as already proposed by Asgharzadeh et
    al. (2007) and Wild-Pfeiffer (2008). We present a computer program for
    the direct computation of the GGT caused by a tesseroid using the GLQ.
    The accuracy of this implementation was evaluated by comparing its
    results with the result of analytical formulas for the special case of a
    spherical cap with computation point located at one of the poles. The GGT
    due to the topographic masses of the Parana basin (SE Brazil) was
    estimated at 260km altitude in an attempt to quantify this effect on the
    GOCE gravity data. The digital elevation model ETOPO1 (Amante and Eakins,
    2009) between 40º W and 65º W and 10º S and 35º S, which includes the
    Paraná Basin, was used to generate a tesseroid model of the topography
    with grid spacing of 10' x 10' and a constant density of 2670 kg/m3. The
    largest amplitude observed was on the second vertical derivative
    component (-0.05 to 1.20 Eötvos) in regions of rough topography, such as
    that along the eastern Brazilian continental margins. These results
    indicate that the GGT due to topographic masses may have amplitudes of
    the same order of magnitude as the GGT due to density anomalies within
    the crust and mantle.

    A ESA (European Space Agency) planeja lançar no outono de 2008 a missão
    GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer). A
    missão foi planejada para medir o campo gravitacional da Terra com
    acurácia e resolução sem precedentes. Para isso, fará uso de um
    gradiômetro de gravidade eletrostático que consiste de três pares de
    acelerômetros idênticos mutuamente ortogonais. O GOCE fornecerá dados do
    tensor gradiente da gravidade (TGG) a uma altitude de órbita de
    aproximadamente 250 km.
    Está sendo desenvolvido um programa computacional para analisar dados do
    TGG sobre as bacias sedimentares brasileiras. O programa utilizará o
    método da Quadratura Gauss-Legendre para efetuar a modelagem direta do
    TGG gerado por feições ou corpos geológicos com geometria esférica. A
    modelagem será feita discretizando o corpo por tesseróides, também
    denominados prismas esféricos. Os tesseróides são segmentos de uma casca
    esférica de espessura finita limitados por linhas de grade geográficas. A
    geometria dos tesseróides possibilita a construção de modelos levando em
    conta a curvatura da Terra. Isto se torna importante na modelagem de
    corpos geológicos com grande extensão lateral, como por exemplo, a bacia
    do Paraná. Será criado um modelo de densidade desta bacia a partir de
    dados de poços e dados sísmicos e utilizaremos o programa desenvolvido
    para obter estimativas do TGG. As estimativas serão comparadas com os
    futuros dados do GOCE na tentativa de separar o componente gravimétrico
    associado às variações de densidade na parte mais profunda da bacia.
