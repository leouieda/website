    Open any text book about seismic data processing and you will inevitably
    find a section about the normal moveout (NMO) correction. When applied to
    a common midpoint (CMP) section, the correction is supposed to turn the
    hyperbola associated with a reflection into a straight horizontal line.
    What most text books won't tell you is <strong>how, exactly, do you apply
    this equation to the data?</strong>
    <br class="mb-3">
    Read on and I'll explain step-by-step how the algorithm for NMO
    correction from Yilmaz (2001) works and how to implement it in Python.
    The accompanying Jupyter notebook contains the full source code, with
    documentation and tests for each function.

    The code and idea for this tutorial came from my Introduction to
    Geophysics courses at UERJ. I came across the problem of implementing NMO
    correction while preparing my lecture and practical exercises on this
    topic. This is a clear example of how learning happens both ways in a
    classroom.

    In this tutorial we'll talk about a widely used method of interpretation
    for potential-field data called Euler deconvolution. Our goal is to
    demonstrate its usefulness and, most importantly, call attention to some
    pitfalls encountered in the interpretation of the results. The code and
    synthetic data required to reproduce our results and figures can be found
    in the accompanying IPython notebooks. The notebooks also expand
    the analysis presented here. We encourage you to download the data and
    try it on your software of choice. For this tutorial we'll use the
    implementation in the open-source Python package Fatiando a Terra.
