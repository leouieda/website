    This was a 1-day workshop/sprint that I organized as part of my SSI
    Fellowship. Our goal was to connect geoscientists from around the UK who
    were interested in open-source and open-science so that we could start
    building something together. I wrote a

- title: "EOS5.3 - The evolving open-science landscape in geosciences: open data, software, publications and community initiatives"
  authors: [RNijzink, NDrost, JFarquharson, AKushnir, FPianosi, SSchymanski, Me, FWadsworth]
  conference: EGU General Assembly
  year: 2021
  abstract: |
    In recent years, the geoscience community has been making strides towards
    making our science more open, inclusive, and accessible, driven both by
    individual- or community-led initiatives and by broader-scale regulatory
    changes. Open-source software, accessible codebases and open online
    collaboration resources (such as GitHub, VHub, etc.) are becoming the norm
    in many disciplines. The open-access publishing landscape has been changing
    too: several geoscience journals have defined data availability policies,
    and many publishers have introduced green and gold open-access options to
    their journal collections. Pre-print servers and grassroots diamond
    open-access journals are changing the readiness with which scholarly
    content can be accessed beyond the traditional paywall model.
    However, good scientific practice requires research results to be
    reproducible, experiments to be repeatable and methods to be reusable. This
    can be a challenge in geosciences, with available data sets that are
    becoming more complex and constantly superseded by new, improved releases.
    Similarly, new models and computational tools keep emerging in different
    versions and programming languages, with a large variability in the quality
    of the documentation. Moreover, how data and models are linked together
    towards scientific output is very rarely documented in a reproducible way.
    As a result, very few published results are reproducible for the general
    reader. These challenges especially apply to hydrology, which is
    highlighted here as an example in the general geosciences.
    This session is designed to gain a community overview of the current
    open-science landscape and how this is expected to evolve in the future. It
    aims to foster a debate on open science, lower the bar for engaging in open
    science and showcase examples, including software and other instruments for
    assisting open research. This may include software and tools, open science
    dissemination platforms (such as pre-print servers and journals), the teams
    driving the development of open-science resources and practices, and
    discussion on the regulatory moves towards standardising open access in the
    scientific community and what those policies mean in practice. The session
    has a focus on hydrological sciences, as an example within the geosciences.
    This session should advance the discussion on open and reproducible
    science, highlight its advantages and also provide the means to bring this
    into practice.

- title: "G4.3 - Acquisition and processing of gravity and magnetic field data and their integrative interpretation"
  authors: [JEbbing, Carla, AGuy, MKaban, Me]
  conference: EGU General Assembly
  year: 2021
  abstract: |
    Gravity and magnetic field data contribute to a wide range of
    geo-scientific research, from imaging the structure of the earth and
    geodynamic processes (e.g. mass transport phenomena or deformation
    processes) to near surface investigations. The session is dedicated to
    contributions related to spatial and temporal variations of the Earth
    gravity and magnetic field at all scales. Contributions to modern potential
    field research are welcome, including instrumental issues, data processing
    techniques, interpretation methods, innovative applications of the results
    and data collected by modern satellite missions (e.g. GOCE, GRACE, Swarm),
    potential theory, as well as case histories.

- title: "Townhall TH25I - Update and Future Directions of the Open-Source Software Initiative"
  authors: [Me, Lindsey, Lion, Rene, Bane]
  conference: AGU Fall Meeting
  year: 2019
  abstract: |
    Open-source software is ubiquitous in modern scientific research and is
    only becoming more critical as the Earth Sciences move into the era of data
    science and cloud computing. Last year, we held a town hall on “The role of
    an open-source software initiative within the AGU” in which we discussed
    some of the technical and social challenges facing software developers and
    maintainers. We collectively identified 3 action-items: (1) work with AGU
    to have “software submissions” at the Fall Meeting, so that authors can
    submit a first-author science-focused abstract and a first-author
    software-focused abstract, (2) assemble resources on best-practices for
    modern research software development, (3) find mechanisms to elevate the
    role of software maintenance and development in AGU outlets, such as blogs
    and EOS articles. In this year’s community town hall, we will share our
    progress, provide trajectories for new contributors to get involved, and
    discuss priorities and new action-items for the Open Source Software
    Initiative in 2020.

- title: "NS21A - A Tour of Open-Source Software Packages for the Geosciences"
  authors: [Lindsey, Rene, Me, Jens]
  conference: AGU Fall Meeting
  year: 2019
  abstract: |
    This session will be a rapid-fire tour (5 min) of open source tools freely
    available for researchers in the geosciences. The fast-growing open source
    software ecosystem is creating new tools and changing paradigms for how
    computers and collaborations are used to study Earth processes. If you have
    written open-source software that could be useful to others, we look
    forward to seeing your submission. This session will not only be an
    opportunity to showcase your own packages and learn  about other available
    tools, we also hope it will be an opportunity to connect with others
    working on related problems and lead to opportunities to form new
    collaborations. The session will be accompanied by a posters where the
    audience can engage individually with the presenters. We welcome
    submissions from all domains.

- title: "Townhall TH25E - The role of an open-source software initiative within the AGU"
  authors: [Lindsey, Lion, Me]
  conference: AGU Fall Meeting
  year: 2018
  abstract: |
    Software is now an essential part of almost any scientific research
    conducted. The spectrum of software used by scientists on a daily basis
    ranges from “mundane” data parsers, to numerical simulations, which solve a
    partial differential equation, to highly domain-specific tools for data
    analysis. The growth of the open-source software ecosystem has increased
    the availability of tools. Importantly, as more researchers open-source
    their software, there is less duplication of efforts in the development of
    routine tasks, strides are being made to improve reproducibility of
    results, and the ability of other researchers to build upon and extend work
    is greatly accelerated. As such, we see that open-source software is
    critical to the future of research in the geosciences. Therefore, we
    propose to start an Open-Source Software Initiative (OSSI) within the AGU.
    In this community forum, we would like to present our vision for the role
    of the OSSI and solicit feedback and ideas from the wider community.
