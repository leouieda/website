    I had the pleasure of giving this talk to the SEG and EAGE Student
    Chapter of the Observatório Nacional (where I went to grad school). It
    was about my path through science and some tips for those wanting to go
    abroad. Slides and talk were in Portuguese.
    The slides were made with <a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a>
