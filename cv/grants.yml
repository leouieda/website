    The magnetization that is locked in certain minerals at the time of their
    formation is one of the few gateways we have to the Earth's distant past.
    By measuring the magnetization of certain rocks we are able to determine
    properties about the Earth's magnetic field in the past, which provides
    crucial information about our planet's climate history and the movement of
    the plates that make up the outermost layer of the Earth. For decades,
    researchers have only been able to make measurements of the average
    magnetic field of each rock sample, which can lead to large uncertainties
    in our estimates or even having to discard entire samples. Recent advances
    in technology are allowing us to make measurements in such detail that we
    may soon be able to distinguish the magnetic fields of the individual
    minerals that make up the rock sample. This new technology opens the door
    to using methods normally applied to national or continental scale
    geophysical surveys to micrometer scale data. There is still much to be
    explored and refined before this can be achieved. This collaboration will
    bring together experts from both large scale geophysics and micrometer
    scale paleomagnetism to explore the possibilities and help define future
    directions of research.

    The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is open source software infrastructure used
    in the Earth, ocean, and planetary geosciences. GMT supports other software
    platforms and delivers data processing and visualizations (graphs, charts,
    maps) that promote new discoveries and their dissemination to society. The
    primary goal of this project is to transition GMT to a governance structure
    that includes a broader and more diverse community of developers. This
    project will (1) recruit and train new and diverse developers, (2) build a
    broad and sustainable developer community, and (3) modernize, simplify, and
    strengthen the GMT software. The first two tasks are critical social
    activities while the last is technical, involving code hardening,
    interoperability improvements, interface modernization, documentation
    completion, and data upgrades. This project will provide training in
    cutting-edge computational software development and data analysis, along
    with engaging undergraduate students in scientifically challenging tasks
    related to the GMT project. The project will also facilitate ongoing user
    training and developer workshops.
    This project is based on a vision for the future of GMT that incorporates
    how governance, communications, developer recruitment and training will
    evolve in the next decade. The project will design and implement a
    sustainable model for GMT maintenance and curation, and execute a series of
    essential technical improvements. These improvements will address a)
    automated testing and verification of results, b) development of
    GMT-powered software libraries in other languages (Python, MATLAB, Julia)
    and c) the recruitment of new and enthusiastic developers so that GMT may
    continue to be maintained and evolve in a changing computational landscape.
    In addition, GMT products such as coastline maps will be revised with
    modern high-resolution data as well as technical documentation of how
    updates are produced. Finally, this project will advance GMT to a
    sustainable environment that results in lower maintenance, greater
    confidence in GMT products, and a more engaged community of users and
    developers.

    The SSI has a yearly fellowship program to fund the organization of
    communities around scientific software (creating of local user groups,
    workshops, hackathons, etc).
    My original plan for the Fellowship was to run some Software Carpentry
    workshops in Liverpool and to develop lesson material for transitioning
    from coder to open-source software maintainer (based on our AGU workshops).
    Due to the COVID19 pandemic, I wasn't able to execute these plans.
    Instead, in 2022 I organized the
    <a href="https://hackmd.io/@leouieda/uk-geo-code-meetup">Geo+Code</a> event
    as part of my Fellowship.

    Research under the EarthScope umbrella involves both data processing and
    display of results. The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is a set of scientific
    analysis and plotting modules that are widely used in the Earth Sciences,
    particularly because they allow for specialized processing and imaging
    suitable for the geosciences. GMT is a long-lived (~30 years) and robust
    NSF-funded software toolset that originated in the ocean sciences but has
    spread to all aspects of the geosciences and beyond. This project will add
    numerous enhancements to GMT, including a much simplified usage syntax
    called modern mode. In addition, new modules for simplifying the creation
    of animations, 3-D stacking and interpolation of grids, conversion of
    imagery for placement in Google Earth, and greatly improved interactive
    documentation will be built during the project.
    The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) scripting has remained remarkably similar
    over its 30 years of existence. Because thousands of GMT classic scripts
    have been written, making major changes has been problematic, even if such
    changes would simplify its usage. The proposed modern mode will solve this
    dilemma as it introduces two new commands (begin and end) that starts and
    end a modern mode session. Hence it is not possible to accidentally enter
    modern mode without the use of those commands, thus allowing all existing
    GMT scripts to run unchanged. Once in modern mode, the required syntax will
    be simplified to avoid repetitive options and the user will no longer be
    responsible for assembling a composite PostScript file. The default output
    format will be PDF but more than one format may be selected, including
    standard raster image formats. Improved interactive documentation will be
    added to showcase modern mode (while maintaining the documentation for
    classic mode). To strengthen EarthScope science there will be new modules
    for 3-D grid stacking and interpolation, KML image quadtree building for
    Google Earth, and a new animation module that vastly simplifies the task of
    building scientific animations. It is anticipated that UNAVCO will assist
    with annual workshops aimed at EarthScope scientists using GMT in shell,
    MATLAB, or Python environments.

    This internal grant funded a full-time graduate technician for the
    Exploration Geophysics Lab (LAGEX) on a 4-year contract. The technician was
    responsible for maintaining the computer hardware we had, working on our
    open-source software <a href="https://www.fatiando.org">Fatiando a Terra</a>,
    and aiding in the teaching done in the lab.
