    Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice (PGCAP) course between
    November 2020 and May 2022. The course was composed of 2 modules ADEV700
    2020/21 and ADEV701 2021/22 totaling about 600h of study.
    I build a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.leouieda.com/pgcap">Portfolio

  abstract: |
    We present methodological improvements to forward modeling and regional
    inversion of satellite gravity data. For this purpose, we developed two
    open-source software projects. The first is a C language suite of
    command-line programs called Tesseroids. The programs calculate the
    gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor of a spherical
    prism, or tesseroid. Tesseroids implements and extends an adaptive
    discretization algorithm to automatically ensure the accuracy of the
    computations. Our numerical experiments show that, to achieve the same
    level of accuracy, the gravitational acceleration components require
    finner discretization than the potential. In turn, the gradient tensor
    requires finner discretization still than the acceleration. The second
    open-source project is Fatiando a Terra, a Python language library for
    inversion, forward modeling, data processing, and visualization. The
    library allows the user to combine the forward modeling and inversion
    tools to implement new inversion methods. The gravity forward modeling
    tools include an implementation of the algorithm used in the Tesseroids
    software. We combined the inversion and tesseroid forward modeling
    utilities of Fatiando a Terra to develop a new method for fast non-linear
    gravity inversion. The method estimates the depth of the crust-mantle
    interface (the Moho) based on observed gravity data using a spherical
    Earth approximation. We extended the computationally efficient Bott's
    method to include smoothness regularization and use tesseroids instead
    right rectangular prisms. The inversion is controlled by three
    hyper-parameters: the regularization parameter, the density-contrast
    between the real Earth and the reference model (the Normal Earth), and
    the depth of the Moho of the Normal Earth. We employ two cross-validation
    procedures to automatically estimate these parameters. Tests on synthetic
    data confirm the capability of the proposed method to estimate smoothly
    varying Moho depths and the three hyper-parameters. Finally, we applied
    the inversion method developed to produce a Moho depth model for South
    America. The estimated Moho depth model fits the gravity data and
    seismological Moho depth estimates in the oceanic areas and the central
    and eastern portions of the continent. We observe large misfits in the
    Andes region, where Moho depth is largest. In Amazon, Solimões, and
    Paraná Basins, the model fits the observed gravity but disagrees with
    seismological estimates. These discrepancies suggest the existence of
    density-anomalies in the crust or upper mantle, as has been suggested in
    the literature.

  abstract: |
    We have developed a new gravity gradient inversion method for estimating
    a 3D density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of rectangular
    prisms. Our method consists of an iterative algorithm that does not
    require the solution of an equation system. Instead, the solution grows
    systematically around user-specified prismatic elements, called "seeds",
    with given density contrasts. Each seed can be assigned a different
    density-contrast value, allowing the interpretation of multiple sources
    with different density contrasts and that produce interfering signals. In
    real world scenarios, some sources might not be targeted for the
    interpretation. Thus, we developed a robust procedure that neither
    requires the isolation of the signal of the targeted sources prior to the
    inversion nor requires substantial prior information about the
    nontargeted sources. In our iterative algorithm, the estimated sources
    grow by the accretion of prisms in the periphery of the current estimate.
    In addition, only the columns of the sensitivity matrix corresponding to
    the prisms in the periphery of the current estimate are needed for the
    computations. Therefore, the individual columns of the sensitivity matrix
    can be calculated on demand and deleted after an accretion takes place,
    greatly reducing the demand for computer memory and processing time.
    Tests on synthetic data show the ability of our method to correctly
    recover the geometry of the targeted sources, even when interfering
    signals produced by nontargeted sources are present. Inverting the data
    from an airborne gravity gradiometry survey flown over the iron ore
    province of Quadrilátero Ferrífero, southeastern Brazil, we estimated a
    compact iron ore body that is in agreement with geologic information and
    previous interpretations.

    In the fourth year of my BSc degree, I went on an international exchange
    program to York University to study in their Geomatics Engineering degree.
    I spent the year learning about geodesy, gravimetry, positioning, and
    least-squares adjustment, all of which I still use to this day.
    I also had a great time in Toronto and got to make a bunch of international
    friends.

    This was when I started development of the software
    <a href="https://github.com/leouieda/tesseroids">Tesseroids</a> and the
    research that lead to the paper which is the first part of my PhD thesis:
    "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1190/geo2015-0204.1">Tesseroids: forward modeling gravitational fields in spherical coordinates</a> (2016)".

    The GOCE satellite mission has the objective of measuring the Earths
    gravitational field with an unprecedented accuracy through the
    measurement of the gravity gradient tensor (GGT). The data provided by
    this mission could be used to study large areas, where the flat Earth
    approximation can have its limitations. In these cases the modeling could
    be done with tesseroids, also called spherical prisms, in order to take
    the Earths curvature into account. The GGT caused by a tesseroid can be
    calculated with numerical integration methods, such as the Gauss-Legendre
    Quadrature (GLQ). In the current project, a computer program was
    developed for the direct calculation of the GGT using the GLQ. The
    accuracy of this implementation was evaluated by comparing its results
    with the result of analytical formulas for the special case of a
    spherical cap. Next, the developed program was used to calculate the
    differences in the GGT caused by the flat Earth approximation. These
    differences reach are up to 30% in the Tzz component for a 50 deg x 50
    deg x 10 km model. Finally, the computer program was used to calculate
    the effect caused by the topographic masses on the GGT at 250 km altitude
    for the Paraná basin region. In regions of large topographical
    variations, the components of the GGT due to the topographic masses have
    amplitudes of the same order of magnitude as the GGT components due to
    density anomalies in the interior of the crust and mantle.
