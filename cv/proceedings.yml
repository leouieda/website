    We developed a method that drastically reduces the number of the source
    location estimates in Euler deconvolution to only one per anomaly. We use
    the analytical estimators of the Euler solutions. Our approach consists in
    detecting automatically the regions of the anomaly producing consistent
    estimates of the source horizontal coordinates. These regions form plateaus
    in the horizontal coordinate estimates using any structural index (defining
    the geometry of the sources). We identify these plateaus by fitting a
    first-degree polynomial to the horizontal coordinate estimates with a
    moving-window operator which spans these estimates. The places where the
    angular-coefficients estimates are closest to zero identify the plateaus of
    the horizontal coordinate estimates where consistent estimates of the
    horizontal source positions are found. The sample means of these horizontal
    coordinate estimates are the best estimates. The best structural index is
    the one that yields the minimum correlation between the total-field anomaly
    and the estimated base level over each plateau. By using the estimated
    structural index for each plateau, we extract the depth estimates over the
    corresponding plateau. The sample means of these estimates are the best
    depth estimates. Test on real data over alkaline bodies, central Brazil,
    retrieved sphere-like sources suggesting 3D bodies.

    Geophysics is the science of using physical observations of the Earth to
    infer its inner structure. Generally, this is done with a variety of
    numerical modeling techniques and inverse problems. The development of new
    algorithms usually involves copy and pasting of code, which leads to errors
    and poor code reuse. Fatiando a Terra is a Python library that aims to
    automate common tasks and unify the modeling pipeline inside of the Python
    language. This allows users to replace the traditional shell scripting with
    more versatile and powerful Python scripting. The library can also be used
    as an API for developing stand-alone programs. Algorithms implemented in
    Fatiando a Terra can be combined to build upon existing functionality. This
    flexibility facilitates prototyping of new algorithms and quickly building
    interactive teaching exercises. In the future, we plan to continuously
    implement sample problems to help teach geophysics as well as classic and
    state-of-the-art algorithms.

    Use of the "shape-of-anomaly" data misfit in 3D inversion by planting

    We present an improvement to the method of 3D gravity gradient inversion by
    planting anomalous densities. This method estimates a density-contrast
    distribution defined on a grid of right-rectangular prisms. Instead of
    solving large equation systems, the method uses a systematic search
    algorithm to grow the solution, one prism at a time, around user-specified
    prisms called “seeds”. These seeds have known density contrasts and the
    solution is constrained to be concentrated around the seeds as well as have
    their density contrasts. Thus, prior geologic and geophysical information
    are incorporated into the inverse problem through the seeds. However, this
    leads to a strong dependence of the solution on the correct location,
    density contrast, and number of seeds used. Our improvement to this method
    consists of using the “shape-of-anomaly” data-misfit function in
    conjunction with the l2-norm data-misfit function. The shape-of-anomaly
    function measures the different in shape between the observed and predicted
    data and is insensitive to differences in amplitude. Tests on synthetic and
    real data show that the improved method not only has an increased
    robustness with respect to the number of seeds and their locations, but
    also provides a better fit of the observed data.

    Iron ore interpretation using gravity-gradient inversions in the Carajás,
    Brazil

  abstract: |
    We have interpreted the airborne gravity gradiometry data from Carajás
    Mineral Province (CMP), Brazil, by using two different 3D inversion methods.
    Both inversion methods parameterized the Earth's subsurface into prismatic
    cells and estimate the 3D density-contrast distribution that retrieves an
    image of geologic sources subject to an acceptable data misfit. The first
    inversion method imposes smoothness on the solution by solving a linear
    system that minimizes an depth weighted L2 model objective function of
    density-contrast distribution. The second imposes compactness on the solution
    by using an iterative growth algorithm solved by a systematic search
    algorithm that accretes mass around user-specified prisms called “seeds”.
    Using these two inversion methods, the interpretation of full tensor gravity
    gradiometry data from an iron ore deposit in the area named N1 at CMP shows
    the consistent geometry and the depth of iron orebody. To date, the maximum
    depth of the iron orebody is assumed to be 200 m based on the maximum depth
    attained by the deepest well drilled in this study area. However, both
    inversion results exhibit a source whose maximum bottom depth is greater than
    200 m. These results give rise two interpretations: i) the iron orebody may
    present its depth to the bottom greater than the maximum depth of 200 m
    attained by the deepest borehole; or ii) the iron orebody may be 200 m deep
    and the rocks below may be jaspilite whose density is close to that of soft
    hematite.

    Optimal forward calculation method of the Marussi tensor due to a geologic

  abstract: |
    The new observations of GOCE present a challenge to develop new calculation
    methods that take into account the sphericity of the Earth. We address this
    problem by using a discretization with a series of tesseroids. There is no
    closed formula giving the gravitational fields of the tesseroid and
    numerical integration methods must be used, such as the Gauss Legendre
    Cubature (GLC). A problem that arises is that the computation times with
    the tesseroids are high. Therefore, it is important to optimize the
    computations while maintaining the desired accuracy. This optimization was
    done using an adaptive computation scheme that consists of using a fixed
    GLC order and recursively subdividing the tesseroids. We have obtained an
    optimum ratio between the size of the tesseroid and its distance from the
    computation point. Furthermore, we show that this size-to-distance ratio is
    different for the gravitational attraction than for the gravity gradient
    tensor.

    density-contrast distribution defined on a grid of prisms. Our method
    consists of an iterative algorithm that does not require the solution of a
    large equation system. Instead, the solution grows systematically around
    user-specified prismatic elements called “seeds”. Each seed can have a
    different density contrast, allowing the interpretation of multiple bodies
    with different density contrasts and interfering gravitational effects. The
    compactness of the solution around the seeds is imposed by means of a
    regularizing function. The solution grows by the accretion of neighboring
    prisms of the current solution. The prisms for the accretion are chosen by
    systematically searching the set of current neighboring prisms. Therefore,
    this approach allows that the columns of the Jacobian matrix be calculated
    on demand. This is a known technique from computer science called “lazy
    evaluation”, which greatly reduces the demand of computer memory and
    processing time. Test on synthetic data and on real data collected over the
    ultramafic Cana Brava complex, central Brazil, confirmed the ability of our
    method in detecting sharp and compact bodies.

    We have interpreted the airborne gravity gradiometry data from Quadrilátero
    Ferrífero, an iron ore province in southeastern Brazil. Aiming at
    retrieving the geometry of the iron body, we have used a fast and novel
    gravity inversion method for estimating a 3D density‐contrast distribution
    defined on a grid of prisms. This inversion approach combines robust
    data‐fitting with an iterative procedure that does not require the solution
    of a large equation system. By using a systematic search algorithm, the
    estimated mass grows around prismatic elements called “seeds”. The
    interpreter specifies the locations and the associated density contrasts of
    the seeds. Automatically, the inversion method fits the observations and
    favors compact gravity sources closest to the seeds. To produce a more
    robust data fitting than least‐squares fit, the inversion method minimizes
    the L1—norm of the residuals. Hence, it allows the presence of large
    residuals, so that outliers produced by non‐targeted bodies can be handled.
    By using 126 seeds which were assigned density contrasts of 0.5 g.cm−3 and
    whose locations were based on our knowledge about the QF area, we have
    retrieved a continuous elongated iron body that fits the observed
    components of the gravity gradient. Our inversion result agrees reasonably
    with previous geophysical interpretations. In addition, our result honors
    the borehole information about the iron body depth.
