    Potential field data often require interpolation onto a regular grid at constant height before further analysis. A widely used approach for this is the equivalent sources technique, which has been adapted over time to improve its computational efficiency and accuracy of the predictions. However, many of these approaches still face challenges, including border effects in the predictions or reliance on a stabilising parameter. To address these limitations, we introduce the dual-layer gradient-boosted equivalent sources to: (1) use a dual-layer approach to improve the predictions of long-wavelength signals and reduce border effect; (2) use block-averaging and the gradient-boosted equivalent sources method to reduce the computational load; (3) apply Block K-Fold cross-validation to guide optimal parameter selection for the model. The proposed method was tested on both synthetic datasets and the ICEGRAV aeromagnetic dataset to evaluate the methods ability to interpolate and upward continue onto a regular grid at constant height as well as predict the amplitude of the anomalous field from total-field anomaly data. The dual-layer approach proved superior to the single-layer approach at predicting both short- and long-wavelength signals, particularly in the presence of truncated long-wavelength anomalies. The use of block-averaging and the gradient-boosting method make our dual-layer approach computationally light, being able to grid over 400,000 data points in under 2 minutes on a moderate workstation computer.

    This is the first paper of India's PhD thesis. It was motivated by our desire to improve the currently available magnetic data products available for Antarctica. We realised that more sophisticated methods of interpolating and joining the different survey data were needed and that equivalent sources was likely the way forward. These results serve as the basis for further exploration into the challenging Antarctic magnetic datasets.

    Scientists often study entire samples to understand their overall
    properties, but this approach can miss important details. To get a clearer
    picture, researchers are improving methods that focus on smaller regions of
    a sample. In paleomagnetism, a field that studies the Earth's ancient
    magnetic field, magnetic microscopy allows scientists to examine tiny areas
    with high precision. In this study, we use magnetic microscopy data to
    determine the direction of magnetization in samples. To do this, we apply
    a mathematical method called Euler deconvolution, which helps solve complex
    calculations and reduce uncertainty. We also refine our results with an
    additional step that improves accuracy and removes unwanted signals. We
    tested this approach on both simulated and real data. Our results show that
    this new method can detect weaker magnetic sources and accurately determine
    the direction of magnetization. When applied to real samples, it
    successfully identified their original magnetic direction. This represents
    an important step in using magnetic microscopy for paleomagnetic research.

    This is the second contribution from Gelson's PhD thesis. We improved our
    <a href"https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GC011082">original method</a> using an
    iterative scheme to strip the effects of larger dipoles from the signal and
    a non-linear inversion step. The result is that the new method is able to
    cope with much denser distributions of magnetic particles.

    A recent editorial in Nature Methods, "Giving Software its Due",
    described challenges related to the development of research software and
    highlighted, in particular, the challenge of software publication and
    citation. Here, we call attention to a system that we have developed that
    enables community-driven software review, publication, and
    citation: The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open-source
    project and an open access journal that provides a light-weight
    publishing process for research software. Focused on and based in open
    platforms and on a community of contributors, JOSS evidently satisfies a
    pressing need, having already published more than 500 articles in
    approximately three years of existence.

    This correspondence was written by the editorial board of the
    <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of Open Source Software</a> in
    response to the Nature Methods editorial
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0350-x">"Giving Software its Due"</a>.
    It was not accepted as a comment on the editorial so we published it as a
    preprint instead.
