    Micropaleomagnetic analysis offers a path to high-precision reconstructions
    of ancient magnetic fields from terrestrial and space-returned samples by
    inverting the vertical stray field of individual particles to recover their
    magnetic moments through the use of magnetic microscopes. Constraining such
    inversions requires a detailed understanding of how domain state influences
    the dipolar and non-dipolar components of the stray field with distance.
    Here, we use micromagnetic solutions of remanent states in real, irregular
    sub- to near-micron magnetite particle morphologies to calculate vertical
    stray fields at various heights, evaluating how dipolar and non-dipolar
    signals can be recovered with both simple Cartesian dipole and multidipolar
    models in the presence and absence of noise. Our results show that
    single-domain and single-vortex state (SV) grains produce strong dipolar
    anomalies that attenuate rapidly, limiting reliable detection to
    observation heights below ∼1μm for 5nT noise or ∼0.5μm for 50nT noise.
    Larger SV or multivortex grains remain detectable to ∼5-10μm but with
    reduced moment fidelity. Multipolar components decay orders of magnitude
    faster than the dipole and are quickly lost in noise at practical
    distances. Dipole-only inversions yield stable, accurate results beyond
    ∼2μm, while multipolar fits can improve near-surface accuracy but add
    significant uncertainty in noisy data. Because strongly non-dipolar
    anomalies observed at heights ≥1-2μm may arise from large multidomain
    grains or from the combined response of short- and long-wave signals of
    clusters of particles, they should be interpreted with caution. We
    highlight the need to minimize sensor noise, optimize stand-off distance,
    and carefully interpret signals for robust micropaleomagnetic measurement.

    Scientists often study entire samples to understand their overall
    properties, but this approach can miss important details. To get a clearer
    picture, researchers are improving methods that focus on smaller regions of
    a sample. In paleomagnetism, a field that studies the Earth's ancient
    magnetic field, magnetic microscopy allows scientists to examine tiny areas
    with high precision. In this study, we use magnetic microscopy data to
    determine the direction of magnetization in samples. To do this, we apply
    a mathematical method called Euler deconvolution, which helps solve complex
    calculations and reduce uncertainty. We also refine our results with an
    additional step that improves accuracy and removes unwanted signals. We
    tested this approach on both simulated and real data. Our results show that
    this new method can detect weaker magnetic sources and accurately determine
    the direction of magnetization. When applied to real samples, it
    successfully identified their original magnetic direction. This represents
    an important step in using magnetic microscopy for paleomagnetic research.

    This is the second contribution from Gelson's PhD thesis. We improved our
    <a href"https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GC011082">original method</a> using an
    iterative scheme to strip the effects of larger dipoles from the signal and
    a non-linear inversion step. The result is that the new method is able to
    cope with much denser distributions of magnetic particles.

    A recent editorial in Nature Methods, "Giving Software its Due",
    described challenges related to the development of research software and
    highlighted, in particular, the challenge of software publication and
    citation. Here, we call attention to a system that we have developed that
    enables community-driven software review, publication, and
    citation: The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open-source
    project and an open access journal that provides a light-weight
    publishing process for research software. Focused on and based in open
    platforms and on a community of contributors, JOSS evidently satisfies a
    pressing need, having already published more than 500 articles in
    approximately three years of existence.

    This correspondence was written by the editorial board of the
    <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of Open Source Software</a> in
    response to the Nature Methods editorial
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0350-x">"Giving Software its Due"</a>.
    It was not accepted as a comment on the editorial so we published it as a
    preprint instead.
