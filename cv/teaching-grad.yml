- title: "AGG5957 - Gravimetria e Magnetometria"
  year: 2025 - present
  institution: Universidade de São Paulo
  about: |
    This is a graduate-level class on potential-field methods in geophysics. It
    introduces the fundamental of gravimetry and magnetometry, including
    potential theory and applications. I teach this course with my colleagues
    Renata Constantino and Eder Molina. It is taught jointly with the
    undergraduate version of this module AGG0669.

- title: "AGG5740 - Teoria de Inversão em Geofísica"
  year: 2025 - present
  institution: Universidade de São Paulo
  about: |
    This is graduate-level class on the theory and applications of inverse
    problems in geophysics. I took over teaching of this module from my
    colleague Carlos M. Chaves starting in 2025.

- title: "AGG5949 - Tópicos Gerais de Geofísica"
  year: 2024 - present
  institution: Universidade de São Paulo
  about: |
    This is a graduate-level course for PhD students. The goal is to get them
    to dive deep into topics of geophysics that they haven't studied
    extensively in the past. I teach this module with my colleague Andrea
    Ustra.

- title: "AGG5954 - Modelagem e Interpretação de Dados de Gravimetria e Magnetometria"
  year: 2024
  institution: Universidade de São Paulo
  about: |
    This is a condensed graduate course on potential-field data modeling and
    interpretation. The first iteration of this course in 2024 was taught along
    side the Geophysics Summer School. In the end, we added a graduate level
    course in potential fields so this one became obsolete.
