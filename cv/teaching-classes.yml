    from a quantitative and computational angle.

- title: "AGG5949 - Tópicos Gerais de Geofísica"
  year: 2024 - present
  institution: Universidade de São Paulo
  about: |
    This is a graduate-level course for PhD students. The goal is to get them
    to dive deep into topics of geophysics that they haven't studied
    extensively in the past. I teach this module with my colleague Andrea
    Ustra.

- title: "AGG0110 - Elementos de Geofísica"
  year: 2023 - present
  institution: Universidade de São Paulo
  about: |
    This is a first year module in the "Licenciatura em Geociências e Educação
    Ambiental" degree, a teaching focused degree. It's main purpose is to
    introduce the students to geophysics at a very high level (seismology,
    geomagnetism, and gravimetry). I teach this module with my colleagues
    Marcelo Bianchi and Daniele Brandt.

- title: "AGG0204 - Computação para Geofísicos"
  year: 2024 - 2024
  institution: Universidade de São Paulo

    This is an optional module of the Geophysics BSc that aims to build on the
    coding knowledge the students have gained throughout their degree. My
    colleague Renata Constantino took over the module from 2025 onwards.

- title: "ENVS398 Global Geophysics and Geodynamics"
  year: 2020 - 2023
  github: leouieda/lithosphere
  institution: University of Liverpool
  about: |
    I teach the lithosphere dynamics half of the ENVS398 module,
    the other half being the mantle and core covered by Andy Biggin.
    In my section, we take a look at the Earth's lithosphere from a
    geophysical point of view. We cover available global datasets (gravity,
    magnetics, topography/bathymetry, heat flow, seismic) and geophysical
    models that seek to explain these observations.
    The teaching resources include short lectures and computational
    practicals using Python to explore real data and generate model
    predictions.
    The slides for lectures are create with
    <a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a> so they can be easily kept
    under version control and shared with students in HTML form (hosted on
    GitHub Pages).
    The practicals are organized into Jupyter notebooks with annotations and
    the prerequisite code. During delivery of the practicals, I start with
    a blank version of the notebook and type out the code while I explain
    what I'm doing. This helps control my pacing and make sure students are
    engaged following along.

- title: "ENVS258 Environmental Geophysics"
  year: 2020 - 2023
  github: leouieda/remote-sensing
  institution: University of Liverpool
  about: |
    This is a bit of a strage module.
    During the first 4 weeks of ENVS258, I teach a crash-course on satellite
    remote sensing, including multispectral images, LiDAR and DEMs, and InSAR.
    There is a practical focus and students learn how to manipulate these data
    using scientific Python tools. The highlight of this part of the module is
    the report they have to produce by choosing their own study region,
    downloading public domain imagery, processing it in Python, and writing up
    their results. Some of the reports are truly inspiring (I've incorporated
    some into the practicals) and they are always a pleasure to read and
    provide feedback.
    The next 4 weeks are a field-based course in Everton Park where students
    get to use every piece of geophysics kit we have (GPR, seismic, dGPS,
    magnetic gradiometry, EM31, ERT), each taught by a different lecturer (I
    was in charge of the GPR).

- title: "ENVS123 Introduction to Geoscience and Earth History"
  year: 2019 - 2021
  institution: University of Liverpool
  about: |
    This was an introduction to Earth Sciences module that was taught for
    students from across the School of Environmental Science. It was taught by
    several lecturers, each handling something closer to their expertise. I was
    responsible for the Earth structure, isostasy, and gravimetry parts.

- title: "ENVS363 Geophysics Field School"
  year: 2019 - 2020
  institution: University of Liverpool
  about: |
    This is our final-year field trip for the Geophysics degrees. Until 2019,
    this was a 10-day trip to Tenerife that involved surveys in the Teide
    caldera and an island-wide gravity and magnetic survey. In 2020, we were
    forced to move this class online. After that, my involvement with the
    module stopped as I shifted to other modules.

    The second introduction to geophysics for the Geology BSc. This is a follow
    up to Geofísica I and covers seismics, seismology, electric and
    electromagnetic methods. This content was all created and delivered in
    Portuguese. I also had the chance to design this module entirely from
    scratch since it was brand new.

    Introduction to geophysics for the Geology BSc, covering mostly
    potential-field methods. This is the first contact of the students with
    geophysics. This content was all created and delivered in Portuguese. This
    was the first full module that I taught at UERJ. I had the chance to design
    the content from scratch, which was both exhausting and rewarding.

    Introduction to programming and numerical methods for the Oceanography BSc
    students. This course is the first contact the students have with computer
    programming (using the Python language). I also taught them Git and GitHub
    and made use of the GitHub Classroom platform.
