  thesis: "Correção topográficas utilizando soluções analíticas para o campo gravitacional de tesseroides"

  about: |
    Felipe started working with the group in 2025. He is working as a volunteer
    and will be researching a way to use analytical solutions of the
    gravitational field of a tesseroid for topographic correction. It's a very
    exciting project for us and it may open up a range of applications that we
    currently can't do on the the sphere.

    Paulo started working with the group in 2025. His project is funded by
    a PUB-EDU scholarship from USP. We'll be updating and developing <a
    href="https://www.fatiando.org/tremelique/">Tremelique</a>, a library for
    seismic wave modeling, and testing it in the introduction to seismology
    class.

  about: |
    Gabriel started working with us during his second year of a BSc degree in
    Geophysics. His first project "Mesh refinement in the inversion of gravity
    data through the planting algorithm" was funded by a PIBIC scholarship from
    CNPq from September 2024 until August 2025. After that, he decided to
    switch themes on a new project funded by a PUB-IC scholarship from USP.
