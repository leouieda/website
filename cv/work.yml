  about: |
    This was a mix of a sabbatical from UERJ and a postdoc position. I took a
    leave of absence for 1 year to work with the Generic Mapping Tools team to
    create PyGMT, a widely-used Python library for processing and visualizing
    geophysical data. After this first year was done, I quit my job at UERJ and
    stayed in this role, which was funded for 2.5 years.

    This was my first academic position, which I got while still working on my
    PhD thesis.
    It was a great opportunity to gain some experience,
    particularly in teaching, which turned out to be the thing I like the most
    about the job.
