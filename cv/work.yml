  about: |
    In April 2023, I applied and was selected for a Professor position at my
    <em>alma mater</em>. As part of the selection process, I wrote an
    <a href="https://github.com/leouieda/memorial">academic auto-biography (in Portuguese)</a>,
    which provided an excellent opportunity to reflect back on my career, try
    to find meaning in what I've accomplished, and plan where to invest my time
    and energy going forward. On 21 August 2023, I started this new chapter.

  about: |
    After 2.5 years in Hawaiʻi, I was offered a position to join the Geophysics group
    of the University of Liverpool's
    <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/earth-ocean-and-ecological-sciences/">Department
    of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences</a> on 19 August 2019.
    This was an exciting opportunity to start my own research group and
    navigate the UK system, which was entirely new to me.
    I spent 4 years at Liverpool, with great friends and colleagues, and had
    an overall good time.
    But I felt that the time had come to return home to Brazil, to be closer
    to family and also to once more be a part of a public university system
    that has a strong social justice agenda, like we have in Brazil.

    This was a mix of a sabbatical from UERJ and a postdoc position. I took a
    leave of absence for 1 year to work with the Generic Mapping Tools team to
    create PyGMT, a widely-used Python library for processing and visualizing
    geophysical data. After this first year was done, I quit my job at UERJ and
    stayed in this role, which was funded for 2.5 years.

    This was my first academic position, which I got while still working on my
    PhD thesis.
    It was a great opportunity to gain some experience,
    particularly in teaching, which turned out to be the thing I like the most
    about the job.
