# About

![The poster presented at the meeting.](/images/poster-aogs2018.png)

This is the third presentation I gave about my work on
[GMT/Python](http://www.gmtpython.xyz/) (see my [Scipy2017
talk][/talks/scipy2017] and my [AGU2017 poster][/posters/agu2017]).
This is by far the nicest poster I have ever designed.
It showcases the new support for `gmt.Figure.grdimage`, the built-in Earth
relief datasets in GMT6, and plotting vectors with `gmt.Figure.plot`.
I wanted to have a more sophisticated showcase of `grdimage` but I ran into
some bugs before the conference and wasn't able to finish it in time.
Still, I'm amazed at how few lines of code are required to make the figure in
the poster.
The more I get to know GMT, the more I'm impressed by how much thought and
attention was, and still is, poured into it.

I used the fonts Roboto Mono for code, Roboto for headings, and Barlow for
other text.
All can be downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
The poster was made using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

# Abstract

The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) are used throughout the geosciences to
processes spatial data and create publication quality data visualizations, such
as contour maps, earthquake focal mechanism solutions, and animations. The
software is programmed in the C language and is accessed through a command-line
interface. Recent versions of GMT also provide an Application Programming
Interface (API) that allows access to the core functionality from other
programming languages, potentially expanding the reach of GMT far beyond the
current user base. A GMT toolbox for Matlab using the API has already been
released, and an experimental interface from the Julia language is being
developed. We are building a software library to interface GMT with the Python
programming language. Popularity of Python has grown steadily in the Earth
Sciences due to its simplicity and powerful set of scientific libraries.
However, there is still great need for the geospatial processing and mapping
capabilities of GMT. The GMT/Python library integrates with the scientific
Python ecosystem through the support of common Python data types: numpy
"ndarrays" and Pandas "DataFrames" for tabular data and xarray "Datasets" for
grids. We have also implemented support for the Jupyter notebooks, a web-based
interactive computing environment (an example is available at
[try.gmtpython.xyz](http://try.gmtpython.xyz/). These features will help make
GMT more accessible to students and professional geoscientists who lack an
extensive background in Unix tools and shell scripting. GMT/Python is an
open-source project in early stages of development. The current focus is on the
implementation of a robust set of core routines that implement the bridge
between Python and GMT. Later, we will expand the library to cover the entire
functionality of GMT. A first release is predicted for the late 2018. The
latest documentation and source code can be accessed through the website
[www.gmtpython.xyz](http://www.gmtpython.xyz/).
