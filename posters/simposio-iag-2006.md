# About

This is the first poster I ever made. It was about my first undergraduate
research project at the paleomagnetism lab at the Universidade de São Paulo.
The project lasted for a year and I was able to go to the field and collect
samples from Cambrian dikes.

I can't even find an abstract for this but I like to share it anyway. It's a
good way to see my progress and kind of nostalgic.
