# About

![The poster](/images/poster-simposio-iag-2006.jpg)

This is the first poster I ever made. It was about my first undergraduate
research project at the paleomagnetism lab at the Universidade de São Paulo.
The project lasted for a year and I was able to go to the field and collect
samples from Cambrian dikes in Northeastern Brazil.

I can't even find an abstract for this but I like to share it anyway.
It's kind of nostalgic.
